Don't miss the gripping action with Jun Manjome and Yuriko Edogawa.\n\n≪Description of the work≫.\n\nIn 1966, when the penetration rate of black-and-white televisions exceeded 90%, TBS's \"Ultra Q\" which began airing in January, quickly became a popular program with viewer ratings in the 30% range. Until then, the program offered free weekly encounters with Tsuburaya's monsters, which could only be seen in movie theaters during spring and summer vacations. \n\nIt was no wonder that children waited 1001 days for the Sunday night 7:00 p.m. broadcast. In the publishing world, which is sensitive to the anticipation of the times, Kodansha was the first to recognize the potential of \"Ultra Q\". Ten months before the TV broadcast, the company began serializing the manga in the monthly magazine \"Bokura\". \n\nAfter the initial serialization it was subsequently ceded to a rival, Shueisha's Shonen Book took on the challenge of the first comicalization in its spring vacation extra issue a year later. The first volume, \"I Saw a Bird\" was drawn by Ken Nakajo, who later established his own era with a series of martial arts manga. The magazine received overwhelming support from readers, and Ken Nakajo also published his new drawings in a large-format book called \"komix\" at the time. \n\nMany of the 10 chapters created by Nakajo are long stories with few page restrictions, and they can be said to be a model for TV Manga adaptations.\n\n[Additional Info](http://blog.livedoor.jp/godzitoraman/archives/1002414.html)"},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%98%AD%E5%92%8C%E3%81%AE%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%93%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9F%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88%E3%83%A9Q-%E4%B8%8A-%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%82%B7%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA-433/dp/4775914367/ref=monarch_sidesheet","ap":"ultra-q","cdj":"https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-1023566","mu":"cfe86pz","raw":"https://www.fukkan.com/fk/CartSearchDetail?i_no=68319835"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"36fd93ea-e8b8-445e-b836-358f02b3d33d","name":{"en":"Monsters"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"39730448-9a5f-48a2-85b0-a70db87b1233","name":{"en":"Demons"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"3bb26d85-09d5-4d2e-880c-c34b974339e9","name":{"en":"Ghosts"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"5fff9cde-849c-4d78-aab0-0d52b2ee1d25","name":{"en":"Survival"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"92d6d951-ca5e-429c-ac78-451071cbf064","name":{"en":"Office Workers"}},{"id":"b29d6a3d-1569-4e7a-8caf-7557bc92cd5d","name":{"en":"Gore"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"cdad7e68-1419-41dd-bdce-27753074a640","name":{"en":"Horror"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"e64f6742-c834-471d-8d72-dd51fc02b835","name":{"en":"Aliens"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

Shinichi Wakabayashi, a young man whose father was a genius racer who died in an accident, joins a racing team with the aim of becoming a racer like his father. He grows into a racer who competes around the world while competing with his rivals. This is an ambitious work that aims to create original entertainment while incorporating realistic expressions influenced by the graphic novels that were popular at the time. It was discontinued in the March 1969 issue due to suspension of publication of the magazine. The sequel, which was published in the \"Shonen Book,'' has been made into a book, but this is the first time that the \"Shonen'' version has been included. Most of the parts are reproduced from the manuscript, including 2 pages of color pages and 18 pages of color doors.

Huygens, Director of the Pineron Space Bureau, and his subordinate Dr. Imoshi.\n15 years later, a rocket from Earth causes an unknown nuclear explosion in the Pineron city of Toronto, and this accident sparks a fierce space war between the two peaceful planets! An all-out attack by the Pineron side, which boasts overwhelming scientific power. Just as Earth was about to be attacked, a mysterious boy wearing a mask and cloak appeared on a small space rocket rider...\n\nCommentary\n\"Yusei Kamen'' is the third installment of Glico Theater (Fuji Television) following \"Gigantor'' and \"Yusei Shonen Pappy'', and was produced by TCJ (now Aiken) and aired for a total of 39 episodes from June 1966. It is a TV anime.\nHe appeared with one of the most famous lines in anime history, \"Hold on, come on, Yusei Kamen!'' and the heroic figure of Yusei Kamen, who fights against evil with his deadly weapons Ultra Shooter and Small Space Rocket Rider, captivated many children.\nIn addition, sponsor Ezaki Glico released \"Yusei Kamen Glico,'' which came with a bonus toy, and its popularity remained unwavering.\nBy the way, if you collected and sent in the points for \"Yusei Kamen Glico,'' you could win a \"Yusei Kamen Dress-up Set'' in a lottery, but it was a phantom prize that was difficult for even those involved to obtain.\n\nWith a favorable wind, the manga version of \"Yusei Kamen'', which follows the setting of the anime version, has started simultaneously in Shueisha's monthly boys' magazine \"Shonen Book'', Shogakukan's school year magazine \"Shogakukan Book'', and \"Elementary School 3rd Grade''\n! While the Shogakukan Book version and the \"Third Grade Elementary School'' version focused on the storyline, the Shogakukan Book version and the \"Third Grade Elementary School'' version were developed in the form of short stories, each consisting of a single episode. The illustrations are by Takaharu Kusunoki, who is also responsible for the character designs for the anime version.\nWith the sharp pen touch of his master, Jiro Kuwata, he beautifully depicts a futuristic world that highlights his unique science fiction perspective."},"links":{"mu":"lntjxqq"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"e64f6742-c834-471d-8d72-dd51fc02b835","name":{"en":"Aliens"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}}]}

Aber als Yikyung auf der Suche nach Materialien für Verbesserungen den neueröffneten Turm der Geister betritt, fällt er in einen mysteriösen Bereich des Dungeons, in dem er eine furchteinflössende Leiche findet. „Ding!“ Ein Questfenster öffnet sich und darauf steht ... „Du hast einen Vertrag mit Seo Dawon, einem rachsüchtigen Geist, geschlossen.“ Beim Bewältigen von Quests ist es nicht schlecht, einen oder zwei Begleiter zu haben, besonders wenn einer von ihnen der Geist eines extrem starken und gut aussehenden jungen Mannes ist.

After her mother's pitiful death, Daphne knows that a similar fate awaits her-- but what did she ever do to deserve it? Why does she have to be branded as a wicked child when she's done no wrong?
