Vengeance. Pure and simple, this is a revenge story. Yuki was named as a child of hell by her mother. Yuki's father was killed by a group of men who conspired to use him to start an uprising; they then brutalized her mother. Her mother subsequently killed one of her attackers and ended up in jail, where Yuki is born. Yuki's mother was serving a life sentence; there was no way she could escape and continue her revenge. Consequently, she concocted a plan which included seducing the guards in order to produce a child who could pass beyond the prison walls. Dying in childbirth, Yuki's mother impresses upon a friend the importance of imparting to her infant daughter the necessity of her revenge–the grudge that she could no longer carry, but which she passed to her daughter. The friend agrees to do so, and Yuki (\"snow,\" so named for her snow-white skin) is trained to become the instrument of her mother's vengenace. Twenty years later, Yuki is a skilled assassin. For the price of 1,000 yen she will perform murderous miracles, often proceeding through trickery, deceit, and the assumption that as a woman she poses as little threat to the criminals she is often dispatching."},"links":{"al":"31672","ap":"lady-snowblood","engtl":"https://digital.darkhorse.com/series/116/lady-snowblood","kt":"3564","mal":"1672","mu":"2463"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"799c202e-7daa-44eb-9cf7-8a3c0441531e","name":{"en":"Martial Arts"}},{"id":"81183756-1453-4c81-aa9e-f6e1b63be016","name":{"en":"Samurai"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"b29d6a3d-1569-4e7a-8caf-7557bc92cd5d","name":{"en":"Gore"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

The oldest, Hinano, is pretty, friendly, and easygoing. However, she's also rather messy and lazy in her personal life. The middle sister, Ichino, is stern and easy to anger, but she's incredibly hardworking and does a lot of the chores and cooking around the house. The littlest sister, Satsukino, is a lovable little girl who adores animals and wants to be a vet when she grows up. Together, they live with Kyouno, their extremely strict, though caring, mother.  \n  \nOne day, Satsukino takes in a big, fat, talking cat. After the three sisters convince their mother to let them keep it, they name it Tonnura-san. But what is this mysterious cat, and where does it come from? How will the lives of the Ichinose girls change now that they've accepted Tonnura-san into their family?"},"links":{"al":"54362","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B075FVK9HG","ap":"tonnura-san","kt":"16670","mal":"24362","mu":"40342"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}}]}
