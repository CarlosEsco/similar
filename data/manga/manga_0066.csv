Their books are very funny often involving alternative takes on canon scenes, or just typical slice of life moments with the Z/GT cast in various times and places.

There is a mild theme of Piccolo trying to get into Goku's pants that runs throughout the books, but it's very tame and played up for laughs. It's a gem of a collector's item for any DB doujinshi collector to have in their possession.   \n  \nThere are about 20 books in total, 13 of the original \"Head Cha La\" series, 1 with the name \"Head Cha Lo\", 4 books dealing with the GT books, and two R18 Books with Goku and Piccolo.  \n  \nUnfortunately, this series has yet to be translated into English and we hope that one day some kind translator may wish to pick this series up.  \n  \nThe scans present here will be downscaled and watermarked out of respect for the authors.

Everyone around him questions his tastes, calling her a plain Jane, but to him, it's as if she has a halo over her head. When he gets a friend to ask what her idea of the perfect guy is, she replies \"someone prince-like.\" He takes this literally, and this sets him off on a journey to become the \"Prince\" of her dreams.  \n  \n3) There's Something I Want to Ask You  \nSae receives a phone call from Ayumu, a former classmate of hers. She finds it odd, because it had been years since they had seen each other, and back when they went to the same high school, she had never even spoken to her. When they bump into each other at their high school reunion, she finds that Ayumu has changed completely from her former high school self—with the help of some plastic surgery.

It is an action-adventure drama inspired by Robert Louis Stevenson's book.\n\nThis is the redone version for the Tezuka 400 Complete Works.\n\nWhen time came to collect NTI for the Complete Works, Tezuka had promised that *All* of his works would get collected, but the original version was presumed lost. \n\nTezuka, wishing to keep on his promise, decided to redraw the entire manga from memory. The version restored characters previously cut (like Peter Pan). The original ending was also restored, making this the definitive version of *New Treasure Island*.\n\nAmong other alterations, this 1984 version is a 4Koma manga whereas the original was a mix of 2/3Koma.\n\n\n---\n**Volume 281 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**","fr":"(amazon.fr)\n\nUn jour, un garçon nommé Pete trouve une carte de l'île aux trésors que son défunt père lui a léguée.
