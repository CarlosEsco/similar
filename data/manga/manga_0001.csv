On the Mars continent, a successor is born from the'Elyos' that everyone fears. What twins? But is it a joke of fate? Prince'Ans (Angelus)' is born with poor wings, a symbol of the Elyos. For the Elyos who ruled over the continent by defeating God with the power of their wings, the weak wings were no different from being crippled. The Elyos king who wants a strong successor abandons'Ans' and makes Princess'Dea' the successor. Luckily, the abandoned'Ans' was found by a human adoptive parent and grew up lovingly knowing that he was a human being. However, when their adoptive parents were killed by the demons, they decided to become a knight to defeat the demons. On the other hand, Princess Dea, who is raised as a successor to the Elyos, has an inferiority to'Ans' when he compares it with his younger brother'Ans' whose father has been abandoned. In the end,'Dea' tries to stain the Mars continent with blood once more to prove that he is a true successor. 'Ans' organizes an expedition with the human princess, the giant prince, and the demon prince and goes on an adventure to save the world, but representatives of races with different purposes continue to cause conflict. Moreover, I thought he was a human race, but Ans, who was an Elyos, caused even more confusion in the expedition! Who will be the true king of the confused'Mars' continent!

Ebisu is a spoiled cheeky brat, totally inept and a liar, all of which angers and frustrates Tamon to no end.

But, Ebisu wants Tamon to pay attention to him; he wants to get along with his roommate and become best friends. It's so easy for Ebisu to express his feelings freely, unlike Tamon who keeps his growing infatuation for his roommate a secret.

A non-stop action that unfolds a fierce competition on the stage of Edo!\n\nThis book contains the complete comicalized version of the period drama novel \"Tange Sazen Inuiunkonryu no Maki\" serialized in \"Shonen King\" magazine since 1967, including the frontispiece. (At the same time, the TV version of Tange, starring Eitaro Matsuyama, was aired on TBS.) Drawn by Satoru Ozawa, a talented man who has worked on numerous marine sci-fi cartoons such as \"Submarine 707.\" You can see the Ozawa style here and there, such as arranging the scenario with the appearance of the original character and giving reality to the strength of Sazen, who has one hand and one eye.\n\nAnd the biggest highlight is that Sazen Tange, one of the best superheroes in period dramas, is depicted as a man who has both strength and weakness and is full of humanity."},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/小沢さとる-ebook/dp/B00UYLK2GM/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8\u0026qid=\u0026sr=","bw":"dea8d032eb-594e-436f-a22c-df6dd35b7035","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/395162/","mu":"9ltuj0h"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"81183756-1453-4c81-aa9e-f6e1b63be016","name":{"en":"Samurai"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}}]}

There have been mysterious murders occurring whenever there was fog after heavy rain. There were also rumors about a channel on television airing only at midnight called Mayonaka TV, during which it is said that one can see his/her \"other half\" when staring at the TV screen. After hearing about a recent unsolved murder which occurred during the fog, the characters—the main character, Chie, and Yōsuke—discuss how each of them had attempted to watch the mysterious TV channel and witnessed the murder victim.  \n  \nThe protagonist later realizes that during midnight when the channel is on, his body can phase into his television set as a gateway to enter another world infested with shadows. After discovering this, they all decide to explore. When first completely entering the world, dazed and confused, the main character meets Teddie. Mayonaka TV and the town murders seem to have a connection. The murder victims may be merely victims of Mayonaka TV. Everyone decides that they will together try to solve the mysterious murders by exploring the hidden world of Mayonaka TV.

Aureola asks Megumi to purify the world of the demon beast and to reincarnate as Suria for that purpose. Her purification method is \"Do what you like and be happy!\" Aureola reincarnates her into another world by telling Megumi (Suria) that she likes flowers, \"Grow flowers and be happy if your heart is filled.
