Now he is finally in university and will start going out at night in order to become a delinquent himself…or at least he was supposed to. Instead, he ends up working part-time at a bar that belongs to his mom's friend, the strong delinquent Soushi! Soushi is divorced, has no kids and has settled down now when he's nearing 40. He's the complete opposite of the guy Shota looked up to! Shota takes it upon himself to make sure Soushi remembers his true self, and he starts by giving Soushi his body, even though Soushi doesn't seem to show much interest at all. This is a comedic and explosive love story between a middle-aged, retired delinquent and a rich and pure delinquent-admiring university student!

Pfil is more naïve and innocent, whereas Pamila is more sexually mature and open, although both frequently and easily engage in all sorts of sexual acts. The sexual content varies from intercourse to masturbation, lesbian sex, to fetishism, to bondage, to bestiality (with animals, including birds and insects). The stories often involve the two fairies saving the forest whilst engaging in various sexual acts. The comics often include small educational sections titled \"Pfil’s Educational Comics Corner\", with topics ranging from insect behavior to human anatomy.  \n  \nBondage Fairies was first published in Japan by Kubo Shoten in February 1990 under the title Insect Hunter (インセクト・ハンター), a reference to Pamila and Pfil's role as police officers in the forest. The title was changed in April 1993. The first English translation in the United States used the title Bondage Fairies and was issued by Antarctic Press under their Venus Press imprint in 1994–5.  \nIn the United States, Eros Comix subsequently published four multi-volume series of Bondage Fairies:  \n  \nThe Original Bondage Fairies (Nos. 1-11, 1998–1999)  \nThe New Bondage Fairies (Nos. 1-16, 1996–1998)  \nThe New Bondage Fairies: Fairie Fetish (Nos. 1–8, 1998)  \nBondage Fairies Extreme (Nos. 1-15, 1999–2003) with translations by Toren Smith and Studio Proteus."},"links":{"mu":"mx36hv7"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"pornographic","tags":[{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"a3c67850-4684-404e-9b7f-c69850ee5da6","name":{"en":"Girls' Love"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}}]}

This romantic comedy is a \"Japanese art school confidential\" packed with absurd humor, obscure death metal references, and some expertly placed, dramatic revelations.  \n\"Luncheon of Tears Diary\" is a vibrant, genre-busting tale that also peppers its humor with sharp, dramatic moments. Natsumi Funabashi, a virgin, is an aspiring manga creator on a quest for love and a fulfilling career. Along the way, she has to cope with overzealous men, gang warfare, a mahjong addiction, and a lascivious manga editor.  \nThis collection is rounded off by Samura's hilarious \"Kyoto Super Barhopping Journal: Bloodbath at Midorogaike,\" a rare, autobiographical travel piece."},"links":{"al":"31126","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00AIFYUG2","ap":"ohikkoshi","engtl":"https://www.darkhorse.com/Books/13-546/Ohikkoshi-TPB","kt":"2423","mal":"1126","mu":"5525"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}
