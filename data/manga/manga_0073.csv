They have big ambitions but no track record, so they have difficulty finding sponsors... \"Inazuma Yaro'', which has been serialized in \"Weekly Shonen King'' since 1968, is a hot-blooded racer manga by the well-known racing manga hero Hisashi Sekiya. There are two highlights in this work. One is the story of the main character, Goro Inazuma, who shows lightning-like speed on the circuit , two of his best friends who are mechanics, a sarcastic rival, a respected champion, and other colorful characters, as well as each person's way of life. The other thing is the “car” that is depicted throughout the story. The sight of a race car racing as if it were alive, hurt, and entering the finish line is undeniably the main character behind this work. This is a depiction typical of Hisashi Sekiya, who commented, \" Just by looking at the car, you can feel the life of the car.'' In this reprint, we have added 60 pages of episodes that were not included in the previously published books, making it a complete edition, and we have also included the one-shot work ``Two Helmets'' at the same time.

Teiichi's father, who is now an important bureaucrat, lost the position of student council president during his high school years, and that loss has continually hindered his career.

An idealistic new teacher, Kurosaka Reiko, is determined to use her power to undermine the corrupt political traditions of their school. Her first step is to push a well-liked, highly intelligent, but poor student named Otaka Dan, who is not from the elite feeder middle school, into the political world.

The small number of people gifted with magical potential are trained and then placed into a special government agency as a magic enforcer. Technology has allowed us to bring back the dead if another life is sacrificed. If the court deems it appropriate, a murderer’s life would be sacrificed to revive the victim. However, during this resurrection process, the revived person, called the Returner, comes back with a psychological problem called the Bug where negative emotions such as jealousy, revenge or anger become amplified. If left alone, the Returner becomes consumed in this emotion and, eventually, it will physically manifest itself in the form of a dangerous monster. The true role of the magic enforcer is to eliminate that Bug.  \n  \nNagumo Kento, codenamed Deep Searcher, is a seasoned magic enforcer whose role is \"Searcher\" in where he draws out the evil using his unique power. His brand new partner, Amagi Yoko, codenamed Evil Eater, is a rookie who recently graduated from the academy as a prodigy, even by magic user’s standards. Her job as \"Debugger\" is to use her power to dispose of the evil that Kento brings out and even the experienced members of the magic enforcers are shocked by Yoko’s power. Together, Kento and Yoko work against the seeds of evil to allow Returners to enjoy their second chance at life.
