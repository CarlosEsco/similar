Determined to make it out of the situation alive, she accepts the offer and soon finds herself in the Raotwan Empire of Laseania as Duke Adrian's 12th fiancee candidate, Isella Derhen. Inseo has to act the role for an entire month in order to make it back to earth alive, but this job requires her to deceive not only a few nobles but the entire empire as well as the emperor. Not only that, but Duke Adrian demands that Inseo must never fall in love with him.\n\nMeanwhile, Adrian, the duke and patriach of House Beleskez, is in search of an adequate fiancee to avoid a royal marriage with the emperor's third daughter, Princess Kiersten. Though things would be very simple if the princess were to marry the duke's son, Lord Aslan, political strife complicates the situation and Adrian cannot simply turn down the marriage. Hence, he seeks someone who can act as his fiancee so he would have a justified reason to avoid the royal marriage until Aslan succeeds the dukedom.\n\nWill Inseo win the deal and the opportunity to save her life? Can she and Adrian pull off the tremendous act without getting caught?\n\n---\n\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cPeanutoon\u003e](https://www.peanutoon.com/ko/comic/detail/6767)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cBookCube\u003e](https://www.bookcube.com/toon/detail.asp?webtoon_num=220015)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cRidiBooks\u003e](https://ridibooks.com/books/1515021893)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cToomics\u003e](https://www.toomics.com/uplmscg/episode/toon/6434)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cAnytoon\u003e](https://www.anytoon.co.kr/episode_page.html?ind=6729)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cComico\u003e](https://www.comico.kr/comic/7861)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cMr.Blue\u003e](https://www.mrblue.com/webtoon/wt_000051344)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003ckakao\u003e](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=58596515)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cLezhin\u003e](https://www.lezhin.com/ko/comic/the_fiancee_on_the_30th)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cNaver\u003e](https://series.naver.com/comic/detail.series?productNo=8109413)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cYes24\u003e](http://www.yes24.com/Product/Goods/106384289)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cAladin\u003e](https://www.aladin.co.kr/shop/wproduct.aspx?ItemId=289246503)","ko":"한국의 평범한 대학원생 한인서.\n\n트럭에 치이기 직전 마법사의 요청을 받아 차원을 넘어 라세아니아로 넘어가게 되는데,\n\n그곳에서 벨레스케즈 공작의 약혼녀를 연기해줄 것을 요구받는다.\n\n영 까칠한 벨레스케즈 공작을 설득하여 역할을 따내는 데 성공,\n\n차근차근 완벽한 약혼녀를 연기해나간다.\n\n까칠했던 남자가 다정해지는 순간,\n\n한인서의 가슴도 두근거리기 시작한다.\n\n\n“우리에게 주어진 시간은 고작 30일뿐이지요.\n\n남은 시간, 저는 전력을 다해 당신을 유혹할 겁니다.\n\n---\n\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cPeanutoon\u003e](https://www.peanutoon.com/ko/comic/detail/6767)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cBookCube\u003e](https://www.bookcube.com/toon/detail.asp?webtoon_num=220015)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cRidiBooks\u003e](https://ridibooks.com/books/1515021893)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cToomics\u003e](https://www.toomics.com/uplmscg/episode/toon/6434)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cAnytoon\u003e](https://www.anytoon.co.kr/episode_page.html?ind=6729)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cComico\u003e](https://www.comico.kr/comic/7861)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cMr.Blue\u003e](https://www.mrblue.com/webtoon/wt_000051344)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003ckakao\u003e](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=58596515)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cLezhin\u003e](https://www.lezhin.com/ko/comic/the_fiancee_on_the_30th)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cNaver\u003e](https://series.naver.com/comic/detail.series?productNo=8109413)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cYes24\u003e](http://www.yes24.com/Product/Goods/106384289)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cAladin\u003e](https://www.aladin.co.kr/shop/wproduct.aspx?ItemId=289246503)"},"links":{"engtl":"https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/7861/?languageCode=en","mu":"194434","raw":"https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=58596515"},"originalLanguage":"ko","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"ace04997-f6bd-436e-b261-779182193d3d","name":{"en":"Isekai"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"e197df38-d0e7-43b5-9b09-2842d0c326dd","name":{"en":"Web Comic"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}},{"id":"f5ba408b-0e7a-484d-8d49-4e9125ac96de","name":{"en":"Full Color"}}]}

Meanwhile, five space pilots (Akira Kogane, Takashi Shirogane, Isamu Kurogane, Tsuyoshi Seidou and Hiroshi Suzuichi) return to Earth from their latest space exploration, only to find the planet annihilated by an apocalyptic, thermonuclear war, World War III. Suddenly, the explorers are ambushed, captured and enslaved by the visiting Galra Empire, and then, they are forced to fight for their lives in Emperor Daibazaal's arena.\n\nThe young pilots escape and eventually land on the planet Altea, where they discover the secret of the mighty sentient robot GoLion, the only weapon powerful enough to defeat Emperor Daibazaal's forces. Thousands of years ago, GoLion was an arrogant robot who, after defeating several Beastmen, tried to challenge the goddess of the universe into battle, but failed. For GoLion's hubris, the goddess taught him humility by separating him into five pieces in the form of five lion robots that sailed through space and crash-landed on Altea, to lay in wait for those who would one day reawaken him to fight evil once again.[1][2][3] The Princess of Altea, Fala, recruits the five of them so they can become the new pilots of GoLion and help her start fighting back against the Empire."},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"e64f6742-c834-471d-8d72-dd51fc02b835","name":{"en":"Aliens"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}}]}

The daughter who was abandoned as soon as she was born and was raised in the slums.\n\nIn front of Salk, who's on the verge of being sold as a concubine to a rotten old man, is a noble young lady. A lady who looks identical to Salk and is claiming to be her twin sister.\n\nHee-yeon, whose life is in danger, asks her twin sister, Salk, who she met for the first time after 19 years…\n\n---\nWith its splendid history of five hundred years, Lan Empire has its own share of lights and shadows. Abandoned at birth, Lynx grows up in one of its slums although she is a daughter of the powerful House of Joo, one of four founding families of the empire from its birth. Just as Lynx is about to be sold off as a concubine to a senile old man, a noble lady appears in front of her. Heeyun Joo, the noble lady with a striking similarity to Lynx, claims to be her long lost older twin sister. With her life being extinguished steadily, Heeyun asks that Lynx, her twin younger sister reunited only after 19 years, pose as her.\n\n---\nLynx Joo may be the daughter of one of the Empire's founding families, but being abandoned at birth, she is left to grow up in one of its slums. The future of a woman in the slums is bleak at best, so Lynx is ready for an out. She’s about to be sold off to a senile old man when she’s rescued by a noblewoman who looks just like herself. Claiming to be her older twin sister, Heeyun Joo asks her for a startling favor: to pose as her… or else.\n\n---\n[Original Webtoon](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=53648484)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* English: [COPIN](https://copincomics.com/toon/363), [Pocket Comics](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/1857), [NetComics](https://www.netcomics.com/comic/17330), [Tappytoon](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/the-13th-night)","ko":"500년의 역사를 가진 나라, 란 제국. 건국 당시 황제를 도와 기틀을 마련한 4대 가문 중 주 가문의 딸이지만 태어나자마자 버림받아 빈민가에서 자라난 삵. 정신이 온전치 못한 노인의 첩으로 팔려 갈 위기에 처한 삵 앞에 삵과 똑같이 생긴 귀족 아가씨가 쌍둥이 언니라며 나타난다. 생명이 꺼져가는 희연은 19년 만에 만난 쌍둥이 동생, 삵에게 자신의 대역을 부탁하는데….\n\n---\n[Original Webtoon](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=53648484)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* English: [COPIN](https://copincomics.com/toon/363), [Pocket Comics](https://www.pocketcomics.com/comic/1857), [NetComics](https://www.netcomics.com/comic/17330), [Tappytoon](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/the-13th-night)"},"links":{"ap":"the-13th-night","engtl":"https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/the-13th-night","mu":"164164","raw":"https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=53648484"},"originalLanguage":"ko","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e197df38-d0e7-43b5-9b09-2842d0c326dd","name":{"en":"Web Comic"}},{"id":"f5ba408b-0e7a-484d-8d49-4e9125ac96de","name":{"en":"Full Color"}}]}

As the countdown to Toyoda's retirement is underway, the manga has been reprinted for the first time in 23 years!\n\nSince his debut in 1982, he has depicted the \"fighting spirit\" and \"will to move forward\" in various forms, including \" Blazing Transfer Student\" \" Adversity 9\" \" Burning Pen\" and \"Howling Pen\". The manga is based on his own adolescence.\n\nMost of the main characters in his \"burning\" works are male, but there is one female protagonist who shines brilliantly among them.\n\nThat is Manami Toyoda. Manami Toyoda was a real-life female professional wrestler who created an era in the 1990s under the nickname \"Flying Tennyo.\nThe title of the work is literally \"Burning! Women's Pro Wrestling.\n\nThis documentary manga depicts a black-haired girl gritting her teeth and growing by her own will in the ring, the square jungle, the wonderland of battle.

My half-sister was the novel's heroine, while the male lead was well-known to be cruel and heartless. I was just an extra who died before all the drama started. Sold as a scapegoat for the Halvenkia Empire's peace treaty, I was destined to die, unable to escape my fate.\n\n\"I'm the only man in Halvenkia who's still single. Don't you fancy me?\"\n\nBut all of a sudden, the main character wants to marry me. Your first love, first kiss, and first fling are all with the heroine, but could I take them all for myself?\n\nAlexia, struggling to alter the story in order to survive. Tervion, wanting to keep her all for himself. And Ophelia, the unknown heroine. The original story has now begun to flow in a completely different direction. This is romance fantasy which covers Alexia and Tervion's dreams and fantasies, as the only ones in each other's eyes.\n\n---\n\nAs the bastard child of Anzak's king, Alexia knew she was destined for very little. \"The Book of Wolves\" foretold her destiny as a side character, from her impoverished childhood to her brutal death at the hands of the enemy prince, Tervion. But when Alexia is sent to assassinate him, the story changes. Now she's engaged to him as part of the peace treaty between their two countries. In the face of mortal danger and abandoned by a loveless father in enemy lands, Alexia must decide where her loyalties lie and whose life matters most.\n\n---\n**Original Webtoon:** [Daum](https://webtoon.kakao.com/content/%ED%94%BC%ED%8F%90%EB%AC%BC-%EC%A3%BC%EC%9D%B8%EA%B3%B5%EC%9D%98-%EB%B6%80%EC%9D%B8%EC%9D%B4-%EB%90%98%EC%97%88%EC%8A%B5%EB%8B%88%EB%8B%A4/2495), [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/56940906)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/rewriting-my-husbands-tragic-ending/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc30063)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E6%88%90%E7%82%BA%E8%87%B4%E9%AC%B1%E5%B0%8F%E8%AA%AA%E4%B8%BB%E8%A7%92%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%AB%E4%BA%BA/269)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/Aku-Menjadi-Istri-Tokoh-Utama-Novel-Tragedi/400)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%89%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%9B%E0%B9%87%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%A0%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B2%E0%B9%83%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%82%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8F%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%A1/317)","id":"Pada suatu hari, aku yang hidup kesepian sebagai putri kerajaan Anzac yang terbuang menyadari bahwa tempat ini adalah di dalam novel tragedi.\nTokoh utama wanita novel ini adalah adik satu ayahku, sedangkan tokoh utama prianya adalah pangeran yang terkenal kejam.
