With the strength and regeneration powers of a giant spider, and the ability to command his swarm of arachnids to his will, he combats the malevolent supernatural and is a force to be reckoned with.  \n  \nWhen career woman Megumi is suddenly pursued and attacked by the unholy demons of the afterlife, she seeks the help from the phlegmatic shaman to eradicate the infestation of unholy beasts seeking to take her soul and turn her into a vindictive minion. But as it seems, these demons are more than persistent—everywhere Megumi tries to hide, they follow. With Megumi’s cry for help, is this more than what Akamushi can handle—as he too collapses to the will of their malicious powers?  \n  \nBut why are these creatures of twilight after her?

One day, the eldest sister goes on a training expedition, but does not return. The energetic, peppy, stereo-type-heroine youngest sister goes off to rescue her. There the story begins.\n\nOn her journey, she begins to have perverse dreams about a dark, sinister man with her eldest sister. Out of nowhere, she meets this guy who has a strange, troubled past. He has psycotic phases where he assumes another personality. Sometimes he's nice, and sometimes he gets really evil-looking and tries to seduce her.\n\nShe soon meets many other odd people on her journey and they travel with her. Her journey and the adventures become the main story.\n\n\nNote: After the second volume, Tamayo Akiyama became the sole credited artist."},"links":{"al":"61855","mal":"31855","mu":"4vyv5nw"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}}]}

As a service robot made to assist humans, Robocon couldn't resist the urge to start helping humans as soon as possible, longing to see their happy faces. But his teacher, Gants, was completely right in saying that Robocon wasn't ready to go anywhere: Robocon doesn't understand anything about how humans do things, so he screws up the tasks he's given. This is the story of Robodon's struggles, hijinks, and joys as he lives amongst humans and does his best to make them smile.\n\nThis robot comedy manga was released concurrently with a tokusatsu TV broadcast of the same name, and also spawned a hugely popular line of die-cast toys."},"links":{"mu":"ino0w1g"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"50880a9d-5440-4732-9afb-8f457127e836","name":{"en":"Mecha"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}}]}

This brutal attack becomes infamous as the \"The Day the Angel Fell\", and marks the beginning of humanity's war for survival. The series begins in A.G. 108 when the UE attack the space colony Ovan, where Flit Asuno now lives after he escaped colony Angel before its destruction. Flit's mother shortly before she is killed by the UE, she gives her son an object called \"AGE Device\". Within it he discovers the blueprints for a powerful weapon from the past—the ancient messiah named \"Gundam.\"  \n  \nFrom these blueprints, Flit spends the next several years studying engineering at an Earth Federation base on the Nora space colony and designing the Gundam AGE-1. Seven years later, in A.G. 115, Flit completes the Gundam AGE-1 Normal, just as the UE attack Nora, and make use of it to aid the crew of Federation's battleship \"Diva\" in evacuating the colony's citizens before it is destroyed. Determined to bring the battle to the U.E. for destroying his home twice, Flit agrees to serve at Diva's mobile suit squad piloting the Gundam. After obtaining enough data and military power to establish a course of action, the crew of Diva and their allies launch a sucessful attack that destroyed the U.E.'s secret fortress in the Ambat asteroid. There they learn that the U.E. are actually the descendants of a supposedly failed human mission sent to colonize Mars, left for dead by the Earth Federation, who formed their own nation on the red planet called Veigan."},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0096I6PAQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8\u0026btkr=1","ap":"mobile-suit-gundam-age-first-evolution","bw":"series/968","kt":"12738","mal":"35319","mu":"70694"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"50880a9d-5440-4732-9afb-8f457127e836","name":{"en":"Mecha"}},{"id":"5fff9cde-849c-4d78-aab0-0d52b2ee1d25","name":{"en":"Survival"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"ac72833b-c4e9-4878-b9db-6c8a4a99444a","name":{"en":"Military"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}
