But Takashi is actually half Japanese, and despite his appearance he doesn't even know English and loves eating Japanese food even Tamio can't abide.  \n  \nTamio and Takashi become friends, and despite his perplexity with Takashi's foreign appearance, Tamio quickly develops a strong attachment to the other boy. Tamio earnestly hopes that he and Takashi can stay friends forever. But Takashi remains dissatisfied with life out in the boonies, insisting that someday he's going to leave all this behind.  \n  \nYet Tamio continues to hope and to do anything he can to ensure that Takashi will stay with him–or take him along–no matter where he goes in life, with an intense, endearing, wistful sincerity perhaps telling of sentiments more complicated than Tamio might think."},"links":{"al":"42495","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B074CKWQ3V","ap":"bokutachi-otokonoko","kt":"22837","mal":"12495","mu":"13875"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"5920b825-4181-4a17-beeb-9918b0ff7a30","name":{"en":"Boys' Love"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

Kintaro and Momotaro, celebrities from fairy tales, each join the Giants, Nishitetsu, and have a dream showdown with real-life players such as Oh, Nagashima, and Kaneda. The manga's healthy touch, which is a little different from the usual sports genre, was praised and won the first Kodansha Children's Manga Award. (The complete 9-volume version of Shonen Sunday is now on sale from Shosha.) This book will be published in the school year magazine \"Elementary School First (Second Grade)\" about six years after the series ended in Shonen Sunday. This is the first book that compiles the original works of the same title that were serialized. The story carefully depicts how Kintaro and his friend Kuro-chan, who join the Tokyo Gold, which belongs to a fictional professional baseball league, compete against rival players and American teams. Above all, you can get a glimpse of the author's ideal view of manga through the panel layout and dialogue arranged for school year magazines. Before this work, the same title was serialized for a total of 36 times in the April 1965 issue of \"Elementary School Fourth Grader\" to \"Elementary School Sixth Grader\" March 1968 issue, but this is a digest of the works published in Shonen Sunday.\n\nDigital version delisted since 2021"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"69964a64-2f90-4d33-beeb-f3ed2875eb4c","name":{"en":"Sports"}}]}

Let me teach you.” Ten years later, the 17-year-old Tang Junhe lived in Yang Xuan’s house as his younger brother. The grievances of their past remained unresolved as the two young men fought constantly. “The first one to fall is the loser.

And with that, the story begins. Unfolding on Earth and in far-off galaxies, in the past, the future, and across dimensions, the curtain has risen on the final war between light and darkness. A great, galactic epic spanning the author’s career begins here!  \n  \nKyomu Senki is made up mainly of four series: “The Tiger of 5000 Light Years” serialized in 1980-82. “Kyomu Senshi Miroku” and “Jaki-oh Bakuretsu”, both of which started serialization in 1987, just a few months apart. Lastly, “Skull Killer Jaki-oh”, a mech series set in the 20th century that originally started in 1990.  \n  \nAlong with the four main series, it also includes four short stories: “New Rashoumon”, “Ninja Arts at Honnou Temple: The Black Magic of Koji Kashin”, “The Strange Living Dimension, Dogura”, and “The Dogura War Chronicles”."},"links":{"al":"86802","ap":"kyomu-senki","kt":"35025","mal":"86892","mu":"55997"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"36fd93ea-e8b8-445e-b836-358f02b3d33d","name":{"en":"Monsters"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"39730448-9a5f-48a2-85b0-a70db87b1233","name":{"en":"Demons"}},{"id":"3bb26d85-09d5-4d2e-880c-c34b974339e9","name":{"en":"Ghosts"}},{"id":"489dd859-9b61-4c37-af75-5b18e88daafc","name":{"en":"Ninja"}},{"id":"51d83883-4103-437c-b4b1-731cb73d786c","name":{"en":"Anthology"}},{"id":"81183756-1453-4c81-aa9e-f6e1b63be016","name":{"en":"Samurai"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"b1e97889-25b4-4258-b28b-cd7f4d28ea9b","name":{"en":"Philosophical"}},{"id":"b29d6a3d-1569-4e7a-8caf-7557bc92cd5d","name":{"en":"Gore"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"cdad7e68-1419-41dd-bdce-27753074a640","name":{"en":"Horror"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

A public decree banned citizens from playing any melodies, to prevent further casualties caused by the D2s' hatred for music—even now, in 2047, this prohibition is still in effect. Humanity's only form of defense against the D2s are Musicarts, young women representing pieces of classical music; and Conductors, the ones controlling them.\n\nTakt Asahina, an aloof piano prodigy, finds himself transformed into a Conductor following a spontaneous D2 attack. The same incident kills Anna Schneider's younger sister, Cosette, and brings Takt into contact with his Musicart, Destiny. Searching for a means of stabilizing the pact between themselves, Takt and Destiny—alongside Anna—embark on a perilous journey to the Symphonica Headquarters in New York City.\n\nTakt is in a hurry to reach the city so that he can play the piano again, even though his passion attracts the creatures he has come to despise. Meanwhile, Destiny's sense of duty drags the group into trouble along the way. With a D2-infested path and many more arduous obstacles ahead of them, will the trio make it to New York City in one piece?"},"links":{"al":"151578","mal":"153896"},"originalLanguage":"ja","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}},{"id":"f42fbf9e-188a-447b-9fdc-f19dc1e4d685","name":{"en":"Music"}}]}

Muitos portões surgiram do céu em diferentes continentes da Terra.  \n  \nEstas eram as dungeons, habitadas por monstros ansiosos para devorar, destruir o que é querido para nós: nossa família, liberdade e, o mais importante - a vida. Traição, engano e mentiras! E para quê?  \n  \nMas fechei os olhos… porque já estava morto. Como eu era um pedaço de carne fraco… inútil, e ninguém precisava de mim, fiquei. Mas em um momento eu senti como se estivesse sonhando… Mas descobri que não era um sonho. O que eu vi estava vazio. E não, não era um vazio natural. Este é o Abismo sem limites. Eu apareci onde apenas um tipo de criatura vivia: os monstros.  \n  \nSou apenas um caçador de Rank F, mas… algo me puxou para esse massacre… Eu queria matar… Eu queria viver. Vou devorar tudo o que está aqui. Vou matar tudo que se opõe a mim. Vou voltar para casa… e matar todo mundo!||"},"links":{"kt":"limitless-abyss","mu":"177556","raw":"https://remanga.org/manga/limitless-abyss?subpath=content"},"originalLanguage":"ru","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"9438db5a-7e2a-4ac0-b39e-e0d95a34b8a8","name":{"en":"Video Games"}},{"id":"b29d6a3d-1569-4e7a-8caf-7557bc92cd5d","name":{"en":"Gore"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"e197df38-d0e7-43b5-9b09-2842d0c326dd","name":{"en":"Web Comic"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}}]}
