The beauty I see in front of the mirror is the future tyrant's older sister, Alicia! She's not even a protagonist or an antagonist, but a character that doesn't appear much and gets beheaded by her (future) tyrant little brother. My life is all about escaping that fate from the novel. In the end, I seduced the male lead's merchant friend who also doesn't appear much and was about to leave the country with him. How-e-ver– The face of the man who spent the night with me was extraordinary.\n\n\"I-I'm pretty sure the name I heard yesterday wasn't that name but something else. Uhm, what was it. I-I think it's Sir Lancelot.\"\n\n\"Ah, that's my friend.\"\n\n\"…\"\n\n\"Why, is there a problem?\"\n\nExcuse me, you're asking if there's a problem? A lot. There are a lot of problems with that. …Why is the male lead on my bed?!\n\n---\nIf there’s one thing that ruins a good story, it’s a cliché! Handsome prince? Lame. Damsel in distress? Yawn. Knight in shining armor? Depends... How good is he in bed? Wait, HUH?! Well, Yuna Han is out to make sure her sister’s story is anything but a cliché, only now she'll have to live inside of it. And luckily, she plays a fairly minor role. Her only crime is being the main villain's older sister!

With the remaining human population now living underwater, The Deep Sea 9 Cities Association represent the last hope of mankind. Ai Mayuzumi is the daughter of the head of the research lab, and is an expert water jet bike driver. When the terrorist group Error attacks the city Ai becomes involved with the counter-terrorist group Stelnas, comprised of an all-female team, and led by a girl named Kei, and asks to join them. The group initially resists her efforts to join, but a surprising \"gift\" that Ai possesses, along with the way she handles herself during a kidnapping attempt, eventually sways the opinion of the members of Stelnas.  \n\n\n---\n\n**Links:**  \n- [Anime (sequel) on ANN](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=3250)\n"},"links":{"al":"30274","ap":"daphne-in-the-brilliant-blue","kt":"636","mal":"274","mu":"26612"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"erotica","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"5ca48985-9a9d-4bd8-be29-80dc0303db72","name":{"en":"Crime"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"ac72833b-c4e9-4878-b9db-6c8a4a99444a","name":{"en":"Military"}}]}

Gan's father, a hotdog supercop with the moniker of \"Dan Goda,\" is fed up with this situation to the point where he decides to send Gan to his old educational institution: a fighting school called Roujuu Private High School. There, Gan learns to harness his raw abilities into \"Gunfighting,\" the family martial arts style resembling firearms. Think .44 Magnum punches, Shotgun Fists, Sniper Stances, and you've got the essence of Gun-Fu down.   \n  \nAt his new school Gan also falls madly in love hot chick, Yuki and runs afoul of 17-year old transfer student and sure-to-be-rival Garrick Rider, prodigal master of the Hanged Cross technique. Fights over Yuki's affections take place in the school stadium, but it turns that she has little need for defenders of her honor. Yuki is, like an overwhelming majority of students at Roujuu, a fantastic fighter.

Meanwhile, a contagious disease which causes the infected to grow wings has spread throughout the city, and a unit commonly known as the \"Wing Hunters\" has been formed to deal with these people swiftly and often violently. In this \"Prison\" resides Caim Astraea, a freelance ex-assassin who does odd jobs for his friend, the head of “The Noncorroding Gold Chains”, for money. During one request, Caim finds Eustia, a winged girl who emits the pale purple light characteristic of the \"Gran Forte\" incident years ago.
