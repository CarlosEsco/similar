He then makes his escape, but not before alerting Jagata's butler, Hanawa and Mimio. Mimio and Hanawa investigate what happened before running into the famous detective Shunsaku Ban, Mr. Mustachio.  \n\nMustachio overheard the gunshot as he was close by when it happened. After inquiring into why Jagata may have been targeted, Mimio brings Mustachio to the lab where he was born.\n\nWho is the assailant, what are his intentions, and what is the true nature of the mysterious stone?\n\nTezuka's famous SF work, filled with Adventure, Mystery, and Tragedy!\n\nPart of the famous \"World Trilogy\" consisting of this work, \"Nextworld\", and \"Metropolis\".\n\n\"Lost World\" possesses 5 different versions. The most famous one, this version, is the fourth. The Private Edition, which is also on MangaDex, is the very first version.\n\n---\n**Volume 130 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**","it":"(amazon.it)\nMentre il misterioso pianeta Mamango si avvicina alla Terra, scatenando nel mondo scientifico le più diverse ipotesi sulla sua natura, il giovane Shikishima prosegue i suoi esperimenti per sviluppare il cervello degli animali fino a renderli uguali agli umani. Come sempre, il genere umano si divide tra gli avidi che cercano il profitto ad ogni costo e chi invece rimane fedele ai valori di giustizia e solidarietà: una lotta senza quartiere che inizia sulla Terra e terminerà nelle giungle preistoriche di Mamango. Ispirandosi a «Il mondo perduto» di Conan Doyle e a «L'isola del Dottor Moreau» di Wells, Osamu Tezuka edifica la prima delle sue grandi visioni fantascientifiche. Allora appena ventenne, l'autore mette in scena, già perfettamente caratterizzato, il suo celebre \"star system\" di figure ricorrenti, mentre mescola abilmente umorismo, avventura e dramma. Un classico del manga.","ko":"만화의 신 테즈카 오사무의 이름을 널리 알린 SF만화 3부작 제1탄!\n거장의 눈으로 바라본 인류의 미래와 지구의 역사는 과연?!\n\n태고의 지구에서 떨어져 우주로 날아간 마만고 별!\n오백만 년 만에 지구에 접근한 이 별에 숨겨진 에너지석을 찾기 위해 탐험대가 출동했다!\n탐험대가 본 마만고 별의 세계는?\n소년 과학자의 시키시마 켄이치의 모험이 펼쳐진다!!"},"links":{"al":"31689","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00JPXE7V6/","ap":"lost-world","bw":"de488d63b0-39ee-4465-adc2-1b81285edefd","cdj":"https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-658037?s_ssid=e4176a62746f8bd29","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/312127/","kt":"3594","mal":"1689","mu":"45659","raw":"https://www.fukkan.com/fk/CartSearchDetail?i_no=68332040"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"5ca48985-9a9d-4bd8-be29-80dc0303db72","name":{"en":"Crime"}},{"id":"5fff9cde-849c-4d78-aab0-0d52b2ee1d25","name":{"en":"Survival"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"ac72833b-c4e9-4878-b9db-6c8a4a99444a","name":{"en":"Military"}},{"id":"b1e97889-25b4-4258-b28b-cd7f4d28ea9b","name":{"en":"Philosophical"}},{"id":"b29d6a3d-1569-4e7a-8caf-7557bc92cd5d","name":{"en":"Gore"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e64f6742-c834-471d-8d72-dd51fc02b835","name":{"en":"Aliens"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

Enraptured by the legends within an ancient tome, he makes daily excursions into a nearby ruin in the hope of learning more about the Seraphim and their history, along with his Seraphim childhood friend Mikleo. One day, he is trapped by a cave-in alongside his friend and a young knight named Alisha, who is investigating a series of natural disasters that have been plaguing the world.
