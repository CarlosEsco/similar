However, he had now passed his peak as a player and was frustrated because he could not get the record he wanted. One day, out of the blue, according to the company's policy, a strict order was given to all players who could not break 10.40 in the time trial to leave the club. The players panicked, but it was clear that Sawamura had the highest chance of quitting. A depressed Sawamura is advised by sports doctor Amamiya to become a test subject for a certain experiment. She says she implants tiny devices into his body that tap into his physical potential and enhance his reflexes. Sawamura gives in to Amamiya's persuasion and the temptation to keep the players alive, and undergoes surgery. Ten days later, in the time trial, Sawamura set an astounding record of 10.26 seconds despite being clearly late. Sawamura is elated by a feeling he has never experienced before. However, after that, abnormal phenomena begin to occur in Sawamura's body, such as the feeling that time around him has stopped. On the other hand, the director of the track and field club suspects doping, and the long-standing relationship of trust collapses. The situation progressed beyond Sawamura's expectations."},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B074CJ9SP3?binding=kindle_edition\u0026ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tukn","bw":"series/5927/list","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/167394/","mu":"jyebt24"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"69964a64-2f90-4d33-beeb-f3ed2875eb4c","name":{"en":"Sports"}}]}

However, unlike most textbooks and historical mangas, Date Bashira does not focus on the Shogun or famous figures in history. Instead, it brings to light the untold stories of the things surrounding these famous figures. For example, one story tells about the role of how beautiful young men were always accompanying the shoguns into battle. As women were not allowed into a battle zone, the warlords would use these teenage boys to satisfy their sexual urges.  \n  \nA different chapter tells the history of the wives of the Shoguns and focuses on the female role in the Sengoku era. As young women were forced into arranged marriages, usually as peace offerings or spies, their husbands usually die in battle at a very early age, as it was the era of war. Date Bashira discusses the idea of remarriage for these women and if they were really in love or were playing the role of a wife.  \n  \nDate Bashira takes a different perspective at one of Japan’s most talked about era and even though it is informative, you never get the feeling of a lecture. The beautiful artwork, splash of comedy and the untold, yet interesting historical information really keeps the reader glued onto the pages."},"links":{"al":"49161","ap":"date-bashira","kt":"7217","mal":"19161","mu":"51764"},"originalLanguage":"ja","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}}]}

This work especially depicts the\nmain character Ippei's attachment to his beloved aircraft, the Hayabusa, and the scenes in which Ippei sometimes rides enemy tanks and fighter planes in all directions. This is similar to the relationship between the main character and the motorcycle in his previous work \"Mach Sanshiro'', and Ippei Kuri differentiates \"Oozora no Chikai'' from other war story manga by drawing it not just as a war story manga, but also as a vehicle manga that he specializes in. It is presumed that he was trying to make a difference. In this reprint, we have recorded all the stories and made it a [complete version]. As a side note, many people may be familiar with the \"Kato Hayabusa Combat Team'' as it is a famous unit that has been featured in movies and military songs.

Ten years have passed since DIO’s death, but his presence sticks with many of his former followers - including Hol Horse, a mercenary-turned-freelancer.\n\nOperating from Egypt, Hol Horse is asked by an elderly woman to find her lost parrot - it was trained by the previous owner of Pet Shop, and therefore may also have a stand. After consulting with Boingo, his reluctant partner with the prophetic book Thoth, he discovers the location that the parrot went so he can track it down.\n\nBut Hol Horse is confused. Why would a parrot fly all the way to the small Japanese town of Morioh?\n\nThe first officially-recognized spinoff of the Jojo universe, now in color!"},"originalLanguage":"ja","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"7b2ce280-79ef-4c09-9b58-12b7c23a9b78","name":{"en":"Fan Colored"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"a1f53773-c69a-4ce5-8cab-fffcd90b1565","name":{"en":"Magic"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}}]}
