Ayase struggles to resurrect Toride's memories the only way he knows how: by working some hand magic on Toride-chinko. Unfortunately, he fails his mission and freaks Toride out in the process. Will Toride-kun be able to accept his wacky anatomy as anything other than a strange hallucination? Will he find the courage to talk to Ayase again, or will his fear of his over-excited appendage keep him down?

The government thinks that aliens have come to attack Earth with monsters, and orders the police and Self-Defense Forces to attack!\n\n[Commentary] \"Mashin Bander'' is a special effects work produced during the monster/special effects boom that swept TV and movies from the 1960s. The manga version was written by Satoshi Inoue, who worked as chief assistant under Osamu Tezuka, and began serialization in Akita Shoten's \"Boukenou'' in 1966. Originally, the drama was supposed to be broadcast at the same time, but due to various circumstances, the broadcast was postponed and was not aired until 1969.\nIn the same era, there were also hits with giant robots such as \"Gigantor' and ``Giant Robo'', which made it extremely popular. In particular, the scene in which Bander's calm face disappears when he gets angry and is replaced by a ferocious face is a scene that is burned into the hearts of viewers. This time, it includes episodes and one-shots from the \"Adventurer King\" series. We hope you will enjoy to your heart's content one of the works that was responsible for the monster/special effects boom."},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"50880a9d-5440-4732-9afb-8f457127e836","name":{"en":"Mecha"}},{"id":"e64f6742-c834-471d-8d72-dd51fc02b835","name":{"en":"Aliens"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}}]}

With his parents' vacation house all to themselves during the holidays, he's determined to have Hitomi turn him into a real man. What he doesn't know is that Hitomi started the rumors herself because she was too afraid to admit that… (!!!)  \n  \n- Hold Me, Holy Knight  \nKana has broken up with her boyfriend just in time to make Christmas very lonely. That's when she meets Iikura, a handsome stranger who offers to be her boyfriend for the sake of the holiday. He's a little unorthodox, and shy in the one way that Kana expects a man to be aggressive. Charmed by Iikura's eccentricity, will Kana give both her body and heart to him before the holy night is over?  \n  \n- Totally Pure Heart  \nIt's Valentine's Day at Kurumi's school, and Kurumi made chocolate the night before with someone specific in mind. When it comes down to sink-or-swim, and Kurumi must present it or be stuck with her own hand-made chocolate heart… she sinks. Running from her embarrassment (and her persistent friends), she ends up alone in a room with Matsuura, one of the most popular boys in school who is also doing his best to evade Valentine's Day. Although he's weighed down with chocolate gifts, he's determined to steal Kurumi's pure chocolate heart…  \n  \n- Flower Couple  \nThe continuation of \"Totally Pure Heart.\" Kurumi's friend Chisato is well-meaning when she suggests that confessing love for Matsuura or sleeping with him too often will make him grow tired of the relationship quickly. Kurumi is also well-meaning when she brings Chisato and asks Matsuura to invite a male friend for the \"camping trip for two\" that Matsuura planned. Getting mixed signals from Kurumi and being scrutinized by Chisato, Matsuura is frustrated, and it's only a matter of time before someone cracks.  \n  \n- The Glass Shoe Doesn't Fit  \nMia and Ikurou have been friends since childhood, but lately Ikurou has taken an interest in the lovely Satoe. While Mia drops subtle hints that Ikurou fails to pick up, she gets to constantly hear how she's not quite as cute as Satoe. It becomes too much for Mia, and when another handsome and highly sexual student asks her to be his girlfriend, she has no good reason to refuse. When Ikurou learns of Mia's new male acquisition, the lovely Satoe suddenly seems less attractive to him, but his realization may have come too late…"},"links":{"al":"34061","ap":"baby-pink-kiss","kt":"8923","mal":"4061","mu":"2875"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"erotica","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}}]}

Sanshiro's ex-colleague, wrestler Shin Gozu, appears at Sanshiro's shop . After breaking both of his knees and being fired from the organization he founded, FTO (unrelated to the real professional wrestling organization Pro Wrestling FTO ), he decided to start a new organization and became its ace. She came to beg Sanshirō for his return. But Sanshirō stubbornly refused to shake his head.\n\nLater, Sanshiro becomes concerned about the Gozu, goes to Korakuen Hall to watch the \"Dream Team\" launch match, and sees the Gozu's helpless appearance.\n\nShinto Pro, which was once a major power, collapsed, and the Japanese professional wrestling world entered the Warring States period with 16 groups. Among them, FTO, led by Gozu, who was No. 1 in terms of popularity and ability, was steadily increasing the number of customers. Pro wrestling is a show that deceives children,\" and the five heads also argued, \"Pro wrestling can be enjoyed by both adults and children,\" and did not yield to each other's claims.

By balancing elemental forces with the help of nine Guardians, she keeps the planets stable and the people content…However, the power of the queen is fading and a new queen must be appointed.  \n  \nTwo girls are selected to be the queen candidates: Rosalia de Catargena who comes from a noble family in one of the main domains and the main character, Angelique Limoges, a seemingly ordinary girl.  \n  \nWill Angelique become the holy queen? Or will she fall in love with one of the many handsome Guardians and forfeit her candidacy?  \n  \n——–  \n  \nAngelique follows the story of two candidates to become the ruler of the cosmos. One is very regal and well trained to rule the cosmos. The other, our protagonist, is a wild card with little experience but more heart. Both set out as part of their tests to grow and nurture their own private worlds. Each receives assistance by nine guardians (all male) who use their abilities, known as Sacrea, to help the candidates manage their worlds. The stories revolve around the friendships with our heroine, the guardians, her rival for candidacy, the queen's aide and a few of the citizens of her own world. The second part of the story deals with how the heroine grows and learns from her own mistakes while running her own world on her own quest to become queen of the cosmos.  \n  \nAnimeNewsNetwork Links:  \n[Shiroi Tsubasa no Memoir](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=2310) (OAV)  \n[Seichi Yori Ai o Komete](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4470) (OAV, sequel)  \n[Twin Collection](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4469) (OAV, sequel)  \n  \n[OAV](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=4468) (prequel)  \n[Kokoro no Mezameru Toki](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6675) (spinoff)  \n[Kagayaki no Ashita](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=6865) (sequel)"},"links":{"al":"37852","ap":"angelique","kt":"16049","mal":"7852","mu":"3580"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"65761a2a-415e-47f3-bef2-a9dababba7a6","name":{"en":"Reverse Harem"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}}]}
