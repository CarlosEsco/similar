His exposure to their whimsical and teasing nature leaves him pretty much despising females. However, the high-school idol (Taniyama Maina) ends up having a crush on him. Her best friend is Nakajima Atsumi, your typical sukeban. Hokuto's best friend, Moriyama Syuuichirou, is the young-punk biker. These two friends conspire to hook Hokuto up with Maina, much to Maina's delight and Hokuto's chagrin. Into this setting we interject the jealousy of the rest of the high school, a female rival for Hokuto's attention, a number of fights, the inevitable parents recalling Hokuto, and Maina threatening to run away from home. We could go on, but pretty much everything is in here.","pt":"Hokuto Nanase é um estudante colegial que está morando longe de seus pais e divide apartamento em uma pensão com algumas garotas mais velhas.

My name is Keiki Fujiya and I'm 18 years old. I go to a prep school to get ready for my college entrance exams, though I'm on-and-off with it. As a hobby, I play in a band, which is super dope. \n\nMy family's been in the grocery trade since way back when during the Meiji era, and we're still carrying on the tradition. We have a warehouse, shrine, and temple, which is super rare to have in Tokyo nowadays. Our household maestro is my old man Konpei, who despite being a fogey is in great shape and very active. \nI'm pretty active myself, but not as much as my pops. \n\nOur family is a lively bunch of Tokyoites. We're also called \"Edokko\" which means \"Children of Edo\", \"Edo\" being an old name for Tokyo. \nReally, it just means we've lived here a few decades from my pops and my pops' pops. \n\nSo who do we have in our humble abode? Well, like I said, there's my pops. To be honest he's a bit of an oddball, a \"Queer Pop\" if you will. We also got a high school student named Karin from Toyama Prefecture living with us.\n\nI don't have a mom anymore, so we're not really used to any kind of \"feminine influence\" in our house.  She's a cute girl - very pretty. I'll let you in on something - It's kind of a secret. But I like to treat her like a kid calling her a \"gaki\" or rather, a brat.\n\nBut sharing a roof with a pretty 16 year old girl really gets my heart pounding. My older bro's a really straight edge. Being the eldest son, he gets all the responsibility and they trained him for it. He'll be getting married soon to a chick named Chitose. She's a real looker, I don't know how he found her! I hope to meet her soon. \n\nThat leaves my grandma, who looks like an apricot. Like one of those palmed fruit that was pickled in Edo way back when - She's three hundred years old! Despite how she looks, she's likes to play pranks and is incredibly fit. She also gets along with Karin.\n\nOur Sesame Street's a real-life comedy set in downtown Tokyo. Players are always entering and leaving the stage. I'll introduce them when the chance comes along. \n\nUntil then, bye."},"links":{"mu":"45749"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"92d6d951-ca5e-429c-ac78-451071cbf064","name":{"en":"Office Workers"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"f42fbf9e-188a-447b-9fdc-f19dc1e4d685","name":{"en":"Music"}}]}

A person can exist solely as oneself, because of the memories from the past the individual has. Memories are the roots that define a person and form their personality. \n\nToday’s technology has enabled us to store memories without putting much effort, in forms of pictures, videos, wav files and etc. What would happen in the future, if humans’ memories are dominated by technology? The era that a person’s memory can be deleted, just like deleting files from a memory card. The era that someone can look through a person’s memory, just like opening files from a memory card. Memory Hunter is a story that takes place in a world where all of that became possible.\n\n---\n- [Webtoon PV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORkjElkEU-M)","ko":"인간을 인간답게 하는 것은 무엇일까? \n한 사람이 온전히 자신으로서 존재할 수 있는 이유는 그 사람만의 과거가 담겨있는 기억이 있기 때문이다. 기억은 인간의 자아를 규정짓고 성격을 만들어내는 근원이다. 오늘날 엄청난 기술의 진보는 별다른 노력 없이도 기억을 쉽게 기록할 수 있게 만들었다. 사진, 동영상, 음성 등의 형태로... 만약 더 먼 미래에 인간의 기억이 기술에 의해 완전히 지배된다면 어떻게 될까? 메모리카드에서 파일을 삭제하듯 사람의 기억이 삭제될 수 있는 시대. 메모리카드에서 파일을 열어보듯 사람의 기억을 들여다볼 수 있는 시대. 기억사냥꾼은 그런 시대에 나타날 수 있는 하나의 세계, 그리고 그 세계 속의 한 이야기다.\n\n---\n- [Webtoon PV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ORkjElkEU-M)","ru":"Что делает людей людьми?\nПричина, по которой человек может существовать, — наличие у него памяти, содержащей его собственное прошлое.

But if you are looking for lovingly detailed drawings and fantastic panoramas, you will probably not (yet) be happy here.  \n  \nBecause it is one thing above all else: An introspection; a discussion of yours truly - with me. I love to argue with myself - because I can only win.   \n  \nWhat does that mean in plain language for the story ?  \nVery long and many dialogues. Less action-packed fights, but more action-packed discussions!  \n  \nWhy am I doing this? On the one hand, to find answers; to questions that I don't even know how I would ask, and on the other - and that is much more important - to have fun. For me, telling and reading the comic is like a drug that I don't feel guilty for being addicted to.  \n  \nI hope to be able to conjure this effect within others through the publication.  \n  \nThe german version is the original work and I highly recommend reading it first if you can. Because some things are bound to get „lost in translation“.  \n  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_  \n  \n  \nGenretechnisch ist Duality eine Abenteuer-Fantasy Geschichte.

Ich liebe es, gegen mich selbst Wortgefechte zu führen - denn da kann ich nur gewinnen.   \n  \nWas heißt das im Klartext für die Geschichte?  \nSehr lange und viele Dialoge. Weniger actiongeladene Fights, dafür mehr actiongeladene Diskussionen!  \n  \nWarum mache ich das so? Zum einen, um Antworten zu finden auf Fragen, die ich gar nicht weiß, wie ich sie stellen würde, zum Anderen - und das ist viel wichtiger - um Spaß zu haben. Den Comic zu erzählen und zu lesen ist für mich wie eine Droge, bei deren Einnahme ich kein schlechtes Gewissen habe.  \n  \nIch hoffe durch die Veröffentlichung, diesen Effekt auch bei Anderen erzeugen zu können."},"originalLanguage":"de","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"891cf039-b895-47f0-9229-bef4c96eccd4","name":{"en":"Self-Published"}},{"id":"b1e97889-25b4-4258-b28b-cd7f4d28ea9b","name":{"en":"Philosophical"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"e197df38-d0e7-43b5-9b09-2842d0c326dd","name":{"en":"Web Comic"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}}]}
