But real hoop dreams reflect the desire to be the best. The dream of being able to take the rock, drive the lane, and take it to the hole. That's Nate Torres, branded as the team bench-warmer, just trying to get that shot at high school fame and glory. When he blows his chance to try and make his high school team, he takes his dream to the only place he has left… the streets.   \n  \nAway from the spotlight and glory of organized basketball, Nate Torres discovers himself on a back alley half-court.  \n  \n(Source: Tokyopop; In the Tokyopop edition, the character's names have been Americanized. Tooru Naruse became Nate Torres, for example.)  \n  \n—  \n  \nToru had always wanted to be a hero -the center of attention- But whenever he tried something new, he would always give up, thinking he wasn't good enough. In high school, he enters the basketball team. As usual he ends up on the bench. Toru's childhood friend, Mizuki Kusuda, introduces him to street basketball. When Toru manages to throw the ball into the hoop in a match against Shu, the street basketball champion and member of \"Three Men,\" something changes inside. He realizes that \"if he only has the guts to carry through something without giving up, his dream will come true.\" He teams up with Sawamura, a fabulous 3-point shooter and wins more \"3-on-3\" matches. Toru's devotion to basketball affects everyone around him and his basketball team soon enters the national games.  \n  \n(Source: ANN)"},"links":{"al":"30355","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B078748DL7","ap":"harlem-beat","bw":"4601","cdj":"http://www.cdjapan.co.jp/ebooks/d/BTW10000000312379","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/17714/","kt":"811","mal":"355","mu":"4520"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"69964a64-2f90-4d33-beeb-f3ed2875eb4c","name":{"en":"Sports"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}}]}

Eri has been summoned by a magician named Rex, intent on doing some scientific research observing people from different worlds. Rex is cute, with long dark hair and a rather pained expression at the trials Eri puts him through. Eri is not your average school girl. Instead of being terrified about her current situation, she manages to secure Rex’s promise to summon her again every week. Well OK, so the promise was rather reluctantly given due to a sneaky trick Eri plays involving the alarm on her digital watch. After all, being in a magical world is a lot more exciting than life as a school girl. The manga series chronicles Eri’s adventures in this magical world, as she travels around with Rex and the Prince of that world, a rather bishounen blond named Krueger. Unfortunately for Rex and Krueger, it is somewhat difficult to keep up with the very pushy Eri, and she manages to get them into quite a bit of mischief."},"links":{"al":"34674","ap":"higaeri-quest","kt":"10057","mal":"4674","mu":"18038"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}}]}
