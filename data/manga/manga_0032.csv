She is immediately smitten with her and names her Hug-tan. Alongside Hug-tan is a snarky talking hamster, Hariham Harry, who mutters that Hana \"isn't the one\" before vanishing with the baby.\n\nThe next day, Hana believes the encounter to be a dream, until people all over the city begin collapsing and a giant monster appears, feeding on their energy. As Hana escapes, she spots Hug-tan and Harry under attack. Making a stand to protect them, she and Hug-tan suddenly both glow with energy and a heart-shaped gem forms.\n\nWith the crystal's power, Hana transforms into a hero called \"Cure Yell\" and defeats the monster. Surprised at Hana's power, Harry explains that he and Hug-tan came from a future frozen in time by the Criasu Corporation, the same organization that created the monster.

After a moment of surprise, he understands that a second chance was granted to him: he was allowed to borrow Takuya's body to do what he had to do before his death, i.e. tell his wife and his 8 years old daughter that he deeply loved them and that he regrets that his job couldn't allow him to spend much time with them. Who will believe, however, that he is but Kazuhiro Kubota in another body?"},"links":{"al":"40817","mal":"10817","mu":"90rc68x"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

Super Robot Lifeform Transformers: The Comics collects every issue of the original Generation 1 Transformers manga published in the pages of TV Magazine.   \n  \n**Fight! Super Robot Lifeform Transformers Prologue**  \nHundreds of thousands of years ago there existed a highly-advanced planet called Cybertron. The planet was controlled by two factions of super robot lifeforms: the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticons.  \nTheir endless war drained Cybertron of all its energy, leading to both factions leaving the planet in search of new energy sources. Their battle raged on, eventually reaching the vicinity of prehistoric Earth.  \n  \n**Fight! Super Robot Lifeform Transformers**  \nTrouble is brewing in Tokyo, Japan – Starscream, Skywarp and Thundercracker are on the attack, out to pillage energy and cause some general destruction. But the Autobots have pursued their foes to Japan, and Optimus Prime, Smokescreen, Wheeljack, Trailbreaker and Sideswipe speed onto the scene, just in time for Prime to transform and save a young boy named Kenji.  \n  \n**The Story of Super Robot Lifeforms: The Transformers**  \nResponding to an SOS, an Autobot team consisting of Rodimus Prime, Ultra Magnus, Kup, Blurr, Springer and Arcee head into space at full speed, and discover the spaceship that sent the call for help held prisoner by another.  \n  \n**The Great Transformer War**  \nThe Decepticons have captured Dalton, a brilliant scientist from the planet Elan, but he is refusing to work with them, and the Aerialbots and Protectobots are already on their way towards Trypticon to rescue him.  \n  \n**Great Decisive Battle of Planet Beast!**  \nWith White Leo and Rodimus Prime away, the Decepticons and their Beastformer allies make another attempt to conquer planet Beast.  \n  \n**Transformers: The Headmasters**  \nAs the Autobots and the recently-arrived Autobot Headmasters ruminate on the current state of play – the death of Optimus Prime, their base on the planet Athenia, the power of the Headmasters – Galvatron leads the Decepticon Headmasters in a plot to destroy Battleship Maximus.  \n  \n**Transformers: Super-God Masterforce**  \nAfter the events of The Headmasters, the Autobots and Decepticons have departed Earth… or have they?   \n  \n**Transformers: Victory**   \nThe Victory War begins as Star Saber and Deathsaurus face-off on Earth!  \n  \n**Transformers: Zone**  \nWhen nine of the most powerful Decepticons are gathered together under the rule of Violen Jiger, Autobot Powered Master Dai Atlas must step forward to prevent them from acquiring the power of the mystical Zodiac.   \n  \n**Transformers: The Battlestars**  \nSuper Megatron attempts to pillage energon from an oil rig, only to be confronted by Star Convoy!"},"links":{"al":"109862","kt":"12620","mal":"21985"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"50880a9d-5440-4732-9afb-8f457127e836","name":{"en":"Mecha"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}}]}

No one will even stop to help her up when she falls and each time she applies for a job, she's blithely passed over. Things are getting desperate and if Haruka cannot get a job soon, she may become known as a jobless university graduate – a very unenviable title for any young graduate to bear.  \n  \nSo Haruka decides to lower her expectations. She goes to apply for a job she found on an ad and is shocked by how flippant the interview is. Little does she know, the job she really wanted is already taken and she is now interviewing for a spot as the newest idol… who is supposed to be 17 years old!  \n  \nAnd so begins the birth of a new idol, Haruka 17, and follows the adventures and ordeals Haruka must go through as her star rises. She discovers that the world of an idol can be sleazy, terrifying, and a cruel competition. With the positive and negative relationships she develops with the other people around her, she begins to discover herself as well.  \n  \n---\n  \nHaruka is about to graduate from a first-rate college and is looking for work but no one wants to hire her. Faced with the prospect of becoming a \"shuushoku rounin\" she finally lowers her expectations and decides to apply at a tiny talent agency for a job as an agent. When she shows up for the interview however, it's like no interview she's ever had before. She's asked all sorts of embarrasing questions and asked to say lines in front of a camera.   \n  \nLater she finds out that they thought she was interviewing to become a talent, and the agent position she wanted has already been given away. However, they think she has that special quality that can make someone a star. She refuses at first, but finally gives in. Thus starts Haruka's career in the entertainment industry.\n\n\n---\nOfficial Release:\n- Indonesian release by Level Comics as **Haruka 17** (2007)"},"links":{"al":"38296","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B078748956","ap":"haruka-17","bw":"series/4454/list","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/7299/","kt":"16874","mal":"8296","mu":"12449"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

In spite of the lamentations of the female students, he was named \"Dokadoka Dokkan-sensei\" because he walked around and shouted \"Dokkan\". As soon as he was new, he was noticed by his senior teacher who was noisy, but he himself is very self-paced. And after school, the girls who follow Dokkan sensei are bewildered when they see something unexpected... Volume 1 (2 volumes in total) of a powerful school comedy with a lot of laughter caused by a mysterious teacher full of vitality!!"},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B074CB3JXC?binding=kindle_edition\u0026ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tukn","bw":"series/76338/list","mu":"1wn7hob"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}}]}

Thus begins the adventure of Nina and her friends in ESP club, and of course her 'battles' with Ida to win Ogi.  \n  \nSounds very simple and just like your everyday Shoujo, right? But here's the thing. This manga is a CRAZY, super COMEDY that leaves nothing not to be laughed about.

It was said that he would bring an end to the kingdom, and that his death would bring about its destruction. When the twin prince and princess were born, Len and Rin, Len was discovered to have the birthmark. He was banished to a lonely tower, and Rin was raised as the only princess. However, it ended up being impossible to keep the siblings apart, and soon they formed a deep friendship. Although circumstances may pull them apart, nothing can break the bond they have with each other. They struggle together to survive the treacherous and dangerous world they were born into. This is their story.  \r\n  \r\nBased on the original Vocaloid songs \"Aku no Musume\" (\"Daughter of Evil\") and \"Aku no Meshitsukai\" (\"Servant of Evil\") by Akuno-P (mothy).  \r\n  \r\nThe volume released in 2011 by CR COMICS DX never had a sequel.
