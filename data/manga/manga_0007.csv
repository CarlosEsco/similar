The castle, which is said to have been built by the Earl of Landseer for his wife Rosalind, is a beautiful work of art with ornate workmanship. The castle had an unopened room associated with Rosalind, the former mistress of the castle. Edward opens the door to the room, not caring that Sarah, the caretaker of the castle, stops him. In the room hangs a stunning portrait of a noble and beautiful woman.\n\n\"The Bride of Randolph\": Claudia is an ambitious girl with a yearning for society. One day, an upper-class lady asks Claudia to talk to a young man named Randolph, who is having a mental breakdown and is hallucinating. His hallucination is of his dead fiancée, Regina, a girl who looked exactly like Claudia. It's a little dubious, but Randolph's good looks in the photograph are enough to move Claudia's heart. She decided to enter Weyerhaeuser's mansion on the shore of the lake, thinking it would be a more interesting experience than she usually had during the summer. \n\nThis is a double feature of gorgeous works in which mysterious events take place in gorgeous old castles and chalk pavilions.

He is almost always accompanied by his best friend Saitou Takaki, who is also constantly harassed.  \n  \nAs the pair grow increasingly tired of being victimized they decide to join the titular Karate Club, which is notorious throughout Osaka's youth gangs for training and producing the city's most hardened and toughest teenage thugs while maintaining the facade of a legit school sports club. But when they join the club, they find themselves picked on just as much if not worse by the club's current members. But as the story progresses they grow to be increasingly capable fighters.  \n  \nAlong with the manga's change in attitude and central character, the various teenage fighters throughout the series grew increasingly stronger and even began to tap into superhuman ki abilities, putting Osu!! Karate Bu in the company of other similar epic Shōnen fighting manga such as Yu Yu Hakusho, Dragon Ball, and Fist of the North Star.  \n  \nOsu!! Karate Bu was wildly popular in its native Japan, but is otherwise almost completely unknown in most other countries. It spawned a four episode OVA mini-series released over a period of two years from 1990-1992, a 1990 live action movie, and a 1994 Super Famicom fighting game."},"links":{"al":"42530","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B074CKKXMC","ap":"osu-karate-club","engtl":"https://global.bookwalker.jp/series/140427/osu-karate-club-volume-collections/","kt":"22866","mal":"12530","mu":"43102"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"69964a64-2f90-4d33-beeb-f3ed2875eb4c","name":{"en":"Sports"}},{"id":"799c202e-7daa-44eb-9cf7-8a3c0441531e","name":{"en":"Martial Arts"}},{"id":"b1e97889-25b4-4258-b28b-cd7f4d28ea9b","name":{"en":"Philosophical"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

The only things that ever happen are small quarrels between Mikazuchi and Honoka.\n\nThese peaceful days are shattered when Saya, a mysterious beautiful young woman, is washed upon the shore! The seal of the Yaoyorozu gods has been broken and a group of deformed monsters emerge. Honoka's parents prove powerless before the demons and are killed. Even the holy sword bestowed by the gods to protect the island since ancient times loses its divine powers and splits into two. Now they are faced with absolute danger!\n\nThen, Saya's sacred powers save them. The holy madonna Saya's blessings bestowed through a kiss brings about a Western sword that can destroy horrible monsters instantly. Mikazuchi begins his tumultuous journey carrying the holy sword.\n\nThe story is set in Japan's Edo period, taking us through a whirlpool of conspiracy. The worlds of mythology and legend are interwoven into this definitive romantic action comic. With the slash of the two swords, one divine and one holy, a fascinating, neo-historical romance filled with mystery and surprises unfolds."},"links":{"mal":"13415","mu":"c1b6yrt"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"39730448-9a5f-48a2-85b0-a70db87b1233","name":{"en":"Demons"}},{"id":"81183756-1453-4c81-aa9e-f6e1b63be016","name":{"en":"Samurai"}},{"id":"a1f53773-c69a-4ce5-8cab-fffcd90b1565","name":{"en":"Magic"}},{"id":"b29d6a3d-1569-4e7a-8caf-7557bc92cd5d","name":{"en":"Gore"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}}]}

She has been sentenced to 20 years for murder and is serving time in T Prison, but once a month she goes outside the walls. She becomes a hit woman who kills those who cannot be judged by law. And when she's done her job, she's back in the fence. She's like a boomerang. Hiroshi Izawa is the detective director of the K Prefectural Police's Minami-cho Police Department Investigation Division, and he uses his position to take advantage of a woman who is a witness and suspect in a crime and has a physical relationship with a stimulant. At least 10 women have died as a result. The K Prefectural Police Investigation Office's secret investigation confirmed that it was almost true, but Izawa himself has received the Director General's Award more than 10 times so far, and there is no solid evidence to dispose of it. Permission to go out has been granted to Our Lady of the Crown of Thorns, who destroys evil that cannot be judged by law."},"links":{"ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/112914/A000031332/","mu":"41355x1"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"erotica","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"df33b754-73a3-4c54-80e6-1a74a8058539","name":{"en":"Police"}}]}

The girl he shot, Joana, was unharmed, but she told Vincent a shocking story, and the next morning she disappeared without a trace. Instead, he was visited by an emissary of General Ambrose du Closter, the head of the castle of Scorchloster, a mansion on the shores of a lake. \n\nGeneral Closter was interested in Vincent's books and research and wanted to invite him to his mansion. Vincent went to the house as requested and was introduced to his daughter, Mona Lisa, by the general. \n\nTo Vincent's surprise, Mona Lisa is a duplicate of Joanna. Vincent thought they were the same person, but Mona Lisa told him that she had never met Vincent. The others also testified that Mona Lisa had been at the pavilion yesterday, and no one knew Joana. The Mona Lisa disliked her governess, Miss Corban, and adored her ailing mother, Camilla, who did not recognize her as her own daughter and hated her. The inhabitants of the pavilion are entangled in a complex web of emotions. \n\nSoon, Mona Lisa is at the mercy of a spectacular, bloodcurdling, and horrific love-hate drama. What is the fate of Mona Lisa in \"Mona Lisa's Room,\" Masako Watanabe's masterpiece of bizarre romance? And what is Joanna's true identity? \n\nAlso contains a short mystery one-shot, \"A Kiss For Uncle...\": Liza is a girl of a wealthy background who was taken in by her aunt after her parents died. Liza's 17th birthday is on the horizon - and once she turns 17, she will gain access to a wealthy fortune.

A sponsor of the Imperial Symphony, Lord Kuretake Kimiya, is deathly ill. He calls to his bedside Sanjou Kaoru, who is both the fiancé of his daughter Umeko and an up-and-coming conductor. Lord Kuretake has a very serious request: Many years ago, he had a daughter with a Russian woman and he begs Sanjou to search for her in Shanghai. Because her mother, Anastasia, an opera singer, was a close friend of the princess, when the revolution came, she vanished with the imperial family. Since then, Kuretake has married and had a family, and he wants his daughter Natasha to be raised in his home.\n\nSecretly, Sanjou and his manager Nagaoka travel to Shanghai and Sanjou meets a beautiful girl singing at a jazz club in a hotel. Because she’s scorned for her mixed race, she has become a rough tomboy… and it turns out that girl is Natasha! She has been raised by the Kurisaki family, who own a small restaurant, and she and their son Takeshi are like brother and sister. Sanjou invites Natasha to a concert, but at the last minute she must stand in for the star. Sanjou is amazed by her incredible singing voice. Now he determines not only to bring her home, but to make sure she gets proper opera training and becomes a true prima donna. Even Takeshi tells her it would be best to go to Japan. Takeshi, it turns out, thinks of Natasha as more than a sister. Not wanting to risk never seeing Sanjou again, Natasha goes on the boat with him to Japan.\n\nBut life in Japan proves to be nothing but misery for Natasha. The Kuretake family treats her like a servant and Umeko is suspicious of her relationship with Sanjou. As she travels home from school, Natasha learns that Lord Kuretake has died. She decides to run away. Takeshi has followed her to Japan, and he and Sanjou search desperately for her on the city streets…\n\nsource: https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/wr2mazv/niji-no-natasha"},"links":{"mu":"wr2mazv"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}}]}
