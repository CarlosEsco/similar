I'll Deliver It  \nAogaki Kouhei, a famous designer, was kind to everyone else except to Hasegawa. The weird thing was, he always gave Hasegawa expensive desserts. Hasegawa felt puzzled, but gradually fell in love with the arrogant man. While making a delivery to Aogaki on a rainy day, Aogaki dragged him into his house to wash his feet for him. Did Hasegawa have a special place in Aogaki's heart too?  \n  \n2. The Other Side of the Porch  \nOotomo has fallen for his neighbor, Ichikawa. The two university students attend different colleges and only meet each other once in a while outside the apartment, but will Ichikawa's little white cat help them become closer?  \n  \n3. Satisfaction  \nTall, studly university student Takeuchi Tomoe notices a slim classmate peeking at him whenever they pass each other in the hall. A friend later tells him he saved the pretty classmate, Shibata Daiki, from falling a while back. Takeuchi realizes he is abnormally bothered by Shibata's presence when a part-time teddy bear mascot working at his parents pharmacy reminds him of Shibata… unless there's more to that suit than Takeuchi can see.  \n  \n4. The Beginning  \nAfter getting smashed at a business drinking session the night before, Atsuhiro wakes up in a foreign room to find his business client sitting on top of him. Matsukura (the client) tells Atsuhiro that he brought him home and was raped by him. Atsuhiro is horrified that he could do something like that to Matsukura… but then a second Matsukura walks in saying none of that really happened. Why are there two of them, and what really happened last night?  \n  \n5. The Depth of Love  \nThe older-brother's-friend story. Harigaya Kenichi is the junior of Ryou's nii-san. Ever since Ryou was little, Kenichi has been harassing him. Even now, when Ryou's in high-school and Kenichi is a car dealer, the unpleasant teasing continues… but perhaps it is the old \"tease the one you like\" routine?  \n  \n6. Turnaround Time  \nOokubou used to live near Shimotori… now Shimotori just transferred to work at the hospital Ookubou works at. A reunion after so many years should be joyous… but why did it end up like this?  \n  \n7. 8 Mats of Suite  \nRintarou was kicked out of his house by his mother… now he's living in a tiny, dismal apartment.

The situations they deal with often shine a mournful and cynical light on the human condition, but the staunch friendship between Sabu and Ichi helps them cope.

From 1968-1972, the serialization was moved to Big Comic, causing a shift in demographic.

Her arrest is treated as a mistake when she manages to hide all evidence of Shinichi's murder. Akira's subsequent investigation of Kilico runs into difficulty when he finds that it's too big for a police detective to handle.

They were a hunter-gatherer people nurtured by rich nature, and they were an ethnic group with a unique culture that excelled in singing and dancing. However, when the Japanese government began to develop Hokkaido in the Meiji era, the situation changed. The Ainu were driven out of the land they lived in and were forced to become Japanese under the so-called \"assimilation policy.\" The Ainu had language, but not letters. Thanks to Japanese language education, some people have gradually come to be unable to speak the Ainu language. Even the spiritual foundation of the Ainu language was being lost. Meanwhile, an Ainu girl, Yukie Chiri, and an Ainu language researcher, Kyosuke Kindaichi, have a fateful meeting. Her natural brilliance and her great storyteller from her grandmother, her Sachie was unique in her mastery of Ainu and Japanese. Together with Kindaichi, Yukie begins a big project that will last her life. It is \"Ainu Shinyoshu\"."},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe"}

This book is also the key to learning the unique words, expressions and objects of Iblard.

He plumbs the dissolute depths of human psychology, literally bathing his characters in expansive shadows that paradoxically reveal as much as they obscure. A young man catches a cold after being soaked in the rain and is tended to by his grandmother. He drifts, dreaming of a train trip with an older brother he doesn't have. A traveling salesman comes across a boy lying in the middle of the road and stops to have a cigarette and tell a story that drifts through memories of faces and places, before settling back on the traveling salesman and the boy pretending to not look at the stars. A young woman walks along the river with her bicycle and a friend who is nothing more than a disembodied head, discussing past times together, memories they have of each other."},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%9E%E3%83%83%E3%83%81%E4%B8%80%E6%9C%AC%E3%81%AE%E8%A9%B1-%E9%88%B4%E6%9C%A8-%E7%BF%81%E4%BA%8C/dp/4892891061","engtl":"https://drawnandquarterly.com/books/single-match/","mu":"47039"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"51d83883-4103-437c-b4b1-731cb73d786c","name":{"en":"Anthology"}},{"id":"ac72833b-c4e9-4878-b9db-6c8a4a99444a","name":{"en":"Military"}},{"id":"b1e97889-25b4-4258-b28b-cd7f4d28ea9b","name":{"en":"Philosophical"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"e64f6742-c834-471d-8d72-dd51fc02b835","name":{"en":"Aliens"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}
