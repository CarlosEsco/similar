Even though it's an international school in Tokyo, Japan, the new student (Yonogi Dai) is a Japanese boy. Dai was raised in the US and recently came to Japan for the first time.  \n  \nDai turns out to be a distant person, uncaring about other people and those who want to be his friends. He looks quite cute and gentle but he's actually unsocial and can be harsh. Jerry Morton who's very popular and well liked among the student just wants to ignore this cold Dai, but being the kind hearted (and nosy) boy that he is, he begins to approach Dai.  \n  \nJerry and Marty and their other friends soon find out that indeed Dai is rather difficult to deal with, but it doesn't take long before Dai becomes their friend. However, sometimes when they feel that Dai is getting closer to them he would say or do something that shows that he doesn't really think them as his close friends.  \n  \nThe story then begins to unfold itself. Dai's new friends start to discover the truth about the mysteries surrounding Dai. Why he's in Japan, about his family, about Ken in the States who seems to be the only one he's having personal contact with, and about his relation to a very famous game, \"Sabbath Child\". They discover the real Dai just like Dai discovers his true friends in life, and also himself along the way."},"links":{"al":"50907","ap":"sabbath-cafe","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/509840/","kt":"10143","mal":"20907","mu":"19198"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

Constantly being bullied and degraded, Al’s life was hard but as long as his elder sister, the only family he had, was with him, he felt like he could withstand anything. But one day, his older sister sold herself to a noble to obtain money to free Al. Despairing, Al was ready to give up, but with his friends’ encouragement, he started working, hoping that one day he could buy back his sister.\n\nHowever, a few days later, a servant of that noble came to him and handed him a bag, claiming he was delivering the body back to its place because disposing of it was troublesome. At the very moment Al looked inside the bag, his mind broke.\n\n“Why are we, despite also being human, being treated like tr*sh by people? We all have the same ears and same eyes, and the same color of blood, but it doesn’t matter to anyone. Are we not human?”\n\nHe needed to know. He needed to prove them. Al had decided. From now on, Al and his sister would always be together.\n\nAs he gently rubbed his belly, Al made a vow.\n\n– The next time, it will be their turn to pay the price.\n\nWith those words in his heart, he devoted his whole life improving himself and planning for this single goal.\n\nKnowledge, power, deceit, bribing, betrayal; everything was valid.
