The story features an interesting character in history, Sengoku \"Gonbei\" Hidehisa. Hidehisa began as a low ranking samurai, but he grew into prominence. He made a number of disastrous mistakes in his life, but he somehow managed to not only survive them, but to also regain his status. This manga reveals the mystery of Hidehisa's intriguing life, as the Warring States Period draws towards its close!  \n  \nNote: This appears to be part of a series of manga about Hidehisa's life. The first is \"Sengoku\" (which begins in 1567), the second is \"Sengoku Tensho-ki\", and this series presumably carries on where the second left off. There is also a series that seems to be a prequel: Sengoku Gaiden: Okehazama Senki."},"links":{"al":"78269","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/gp/product/B074CCY7Q9","ap":"sengoku-ittouki","kt":"5780","mal":"48269","mu":"80818","raw":"https://comic-days.com/episode/13932016480030132237"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}}]}

His name is Facade, and he shares his body with four other entities- Wolf Face, a male wolf who has mastered human speech; Twin, a female swan with a double pair of wings; the Professor, who is pure personality without a body of his own; Naaku, a dragon (gender evidently unknown- maybe dragons don't have them); and a fifth person who has yet to appear and about whom nothing is known. Sometimes Facade's co-tenants manifest in their own bodies, sometimes they merely change part of Facade's body into their own. This allows Facade, for instance, to fly with Twin's wings or, in one unusually happy tale in the first volume, to manifest as the god Anubis to a number of ancient Egyptians by grafting Wolf Face's head onto his own human body. \n\nsource: https://www.mangaupdates.com/series/0b2fvvz/facade"},"links":{"mu":"0b2fvvz"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}}]}

Each student has to reach 100 points to be able to start using their ability. Otherwise they won't move up from the \"Common\" and into the \"Starlight\" class. But Rito, known as \"the Eternal 99\", has been stuck with an unchanging 99 points for a long time.  \n  \nSo here comes his new plan: to become a friend with Scuse Fontana, a three-day exchange student from the Demon World, and to ask her for some food. (There's rumor that a human can increase his power by eating food from the Demon World). He slipped into the hotel where a welcome party is being held for the much respected lady, just to find that she's actually absent. Losing hope, he wastes no time leaving the hotel.

The Temple  \nThe story is narrated as a \"found manuscript\" penned by Karl Heinrich, Graf von Altberg-Ehrenstein, a lieutenant-commander in the Imperial German Navy during the days of World War I. It documents his untimely end at the bottom of the ocean. Altberg begins by declaring that he has decided to document the events leading up to his final hour in order to \"set certain facts\" before the public, aware that he will not survive to do so himself.  \n  \n2. The Hound  \nThe story focuses around the narrator and his friend St. John, who have a deranged interest in robbing graves. They constantly defile crypts and often keep souvenirs of their nocturnal expeditions. Since they reside in the same house, they have the opportunity to set up a sort of morbid museum in their basement. Using the objects they collect from the various graves they have robbed, they organize the private exhibition. The collection consists of headstones, preserved bodies, skulls, and several heads in different phases of decomposition. It also included statues, frightful paintings, and a locked portfolio bound in tanned human-skin.  \n  \n3. The Nameless City  \nThe Nameless City, of the story's title, is an ancient ruin located somewhere in the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula, and is older than any human civilization. In ancient times, the Nameless City was built and inhabited by an unnamed race of reptiles with a body shaped like a cross between a crocodile and a seal with a strange head common to neither, involving a protruding forehead, horns, lack of a nose, and an alligator-like jaw. These beings moved by crawling; thus, the architecture of the city has very low ceilings and some places are too low for a human being to stand upright. Their city was originally coastal, but, when the seas receded, it was left in the depths of a desert. This resulted in the decline and eventual ruin of the city."},"links":{"al":"97718","ap":"hp-lovecrafts-the-hound-and-other-stories","bw":"dea69caeed-40ae-4811-81ef-d6ad8260760e","engtl":"https://www.darkhorse.com/Books/29-293","kt":"37755","mal":"90109","mu":"114314"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"51d83883-4103-437c-b4b1-731cb73d786c","name":{"en":"Anthology"}},{"id":"cdad7e68-1419-41dd-bdce-27753074a640","name":{"en":"Horror"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

The organization that spread those flyers was an organization known as a nursery, 'Hannibal'. Beckham showed them his ability to control fire and in return for receiving money for his family, left for England with them. When Beckham arrived at the facility, he met children from all over the world who had special abilities just like him.

That was the first day of the new school term, when she became the second year of her high school. Nearly at the same time she got herself a new friend, Chiyako, a very beautiful transferred student who turned out to be Rui's older sister. For some reason Chiyako was determined to be Natsume's best friend, and naturally there's no way Natsume would refuse Rui's sister–and the easiest method to get to know Rui.  \n  \nNatsume soon learned (mostly from Chiyako) that besides being younger than herself and actually her kouhai, Rui was also a real, professional model, an extremely moody one. He's a spoilt person that often showed a very nasty attitude. To top it all he HATED summer thoroughly and completely. But nothing of these could kill Natsume's love for Rui. How would Natsume, the simple and plain summer girl win Rui's heart? A funny, cheerful and romantic shoujo manga from Yachi Emiko-sensei."},"links":{"al":"50908","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%81%B4%E3%83%BC%E5%A4%8F%E3%81%8C%E3%81%84%E3%81%A3%E3%81%B1%E3%81%84-1-%E3%81%82%E3%81%99%E3%81%8B%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9F%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9-%E8%B0%B7%E5%9C%B0-%E6%81%B5%E7%BE%8E%E5%AD%90/dp/4049240343","ap":"pii-natsu-ga-ippai","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/509841/","kt":"10144","mal":"20908","mu":"34791"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

Out of the land of fire, erupts the cruel yet tragic love story of one evil spirit who yearns to possess the heart of one human woman.  \n  \nOfficial English: [NetComics](https://www.netcomics.com/comic/246), [Tappytoon](https://www.tappytoon.com/en/comics/red-fox), [Pocket Comics](https://www.comico.io/pocket-comics)"},"links":{"al":"128360","engtl":"https://www.lezhin.com/en/comic/redfox","mu":"175406"},"originalLanguage":"ko","contentRating":"erotica","tags":[{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"39730448-9a5f-48a2-85b0-a70db87b1233","name":{"en":"Demons"}},{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"cdad7e68-1419-41dd-bdce-27753074a640","name":{"en":"Horror"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"e197df38-d0e7-43b5-9b09-2842d0c326dd","name":{"en":"Web Comic"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f5ba408b-0e7a-484d-8d49-4e9125ac96de","name":{"en":"Full Color"}}]}

During that time, the younger sister Dalhee became a Moon Fairy. To become a true god, she must reincarnate a certain number of times, but she's never been able to successfully live out her lives. Bored of her life in heaven, she looked down Iseugkyung to look for any troubles in the human world!  \n  \n\"Please help me… I want to die…\"  \n  \n After hearing a sad voice coming from Iseugkyung, she discovered a beautiful girl begging the Grim Reaper to leave her world. Soon after, the Grim Reaper came to take her life. Full of curiosity, Fairy Dalhee went down Iseugkyung and into the hospital room of the human girl.  \n  \nThe woman who begged to die was surrounded by many people, and told Dalhee about her finace, Jiwan, who wasn't even a bit affectionate towards her.   \n  \nHe didn't have a hint of compassion, despite learning that his fiancee was on the brink of death. It was surprising that this kind of person was alive on earth, rather than staying stuck in hell.   \n  \nWho is Dalhee? Is she not a kind and beautiful fairy?  \n  \nWith the thoughts of guiding the spirit to the afterlife, Dalhee decided to live her life as a human without the permission of the Jade Emperor. Her unauthorized reincarnated life begins now.   \n  \nDespite impulsively making up her mind to save the man with a dark soul, Dalhee discovers its quite hard living as a human. Her life is already in tatters due to her fiance, but her younger sister and step mother do their best to make her life even worse. How will she make these humans more humane?   \n  \nThere's a long way to go, but should we start with the fiancee?   \n  \nA Heavenly Fairy vs. Trashy Humans  \nThe Fairy's Trash Clean Up Project starts now!"},"links":{"al":"122045","ap":"lucky-spring-day","mu":"169062","raw":"https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=55085796"},"originalLanguage":"ko","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"0bc90acb-ccc1-44ca-a34a-b9f3a73259d0","name":{"en":"Reincarnation"}},{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"e197df38-d0e7-43b5-9b09-2842d0c326dd","name":{"en":"Web Comic"}},{"id":"f5ba408b-0e7a-484d-8d49-4e9125ac96de","name":{"en":"Full Color"}}]}
