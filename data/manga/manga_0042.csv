It took the shape of an ape but it was much more than that. Physically strong and psychologically powerful, nothing stood in its way. However, one day, this godlike being split into two: the physical part and the mental state. While the power of the physical part grew larger and larger, the mental part spread its energy throughout the planet into humans.\n\nNow, people using black magic are killing those with the spirit in them because as the mental part becomes weaker, the physical side becomes stronger, strong enough to destroy the planet. Elaine Beaulieu was one of those with the mental side inside her and when she was near death, the monkey spirit took over, trying to protect itself. Candid Amantini was sent from the Vatican as an exorcist specialist and learns the truth about the omnipotent ape monster. A Japanese girl named Nana and Nawan Namugyaru, a man who has lost his memory, gets involved in the movement to stop those using black magic from resurrecting the ancient power and destroying Earth.\n\nNote: Nominated for the 4th Manga Taishou Award in 2011.","ru":"Говорят, что глубоко внутри Земли дремлет древняя сила.

В то время как сила физической части становилась всё больше и больше, ментальная часть распространяла свою энергию по всей планете, проникая в людей. Вот и в душе Элейн Болье живёт часть духа Обезьяны. Когда девушка оказалась при смерти, дух Обезьяны взял верх, пытаясь защитить себя.\n\nОднако есть люди, которых не устраивает такое положение вещей, и они используют чёрную магию, чтобы убивать людей, подобных Элейн. Ведь если душа такого человека ослабеет, увеличится физическая сила индивида и тот может уничтожить планету.

Immediately after his birth, Onsenman flew to Tokyo and suggested to Nami Katsuta, a student who had been skipping school to play at an arcade, to relieve her fatigue in a hot spring. Nami rejects Onsenman's suggestion, but Onsenman forces her to enter a hot spring.\n\nAt first, Nami is negative about hot springs, but she soon realizes their charm and becomes a fan. After witnessing this, the Onsenman flies away to heal the modern man who, like Nami, is also exhausted.\n\nThe first volume includes a behind the scenes bonus manga about the making of the story, and the third volume includes a secret story about the research trip.

On her first day, she thought it was going to be a pleasant flight. Not so fast, Yamane. Apart from struggling to learn how to deal with difficult passengers, Rin meets the Chief Attendant, Hanazono Hinako, who appears to be sweet. However, that is just one of her many facets. Her smile and pleasant demeanor are just a pretense—in fact, she is a delinquent feared by everyone. She's a dauntless and win-by-a-large-margin kind of girl, who becomes a completely different person after work. This is a powerful story depicting the activities of dauntless Hinako at 20,000 meters in the air, filled with lots of airline gags.  \n  \nNotes:  \n- Bucchigiri means \"winning (a race) by a wide margin\" or #1, but it has other meanings.

The people of this society were especially skilled at genetic engineering. Using gene manipulation, they were able to develop special designer pets and store their genetic information on stone tablets known as \"disks\", similar to CDs. Using these disks, the artificial animals could be regenerated at special shrines.\n\nHowever, war broke out between the countries of the civilization. The pets were modified into biological weapons, and the war of the monsters began. The great civilizations completely annihilated each other, leaving nothing but relics behind, and much of the world's technology was lost. The monsters were sealed into their mystery disks and hidden away.\n\nCenturies later, as humanity was just beginning to rediscover basic technology, people found the artifacts owned by the so-called \"Ancients\" and attributed divine properties to them. They also discovered the lost disks and shrines. Using these, monsters were again born. Only through the power of the phoenix could the lost discs be revived back into living monsters.\n\nThus started a popular new sport, Monster Breeding. Breeders or trainers raised monsters for battle to compete in nation-wide tournaments to see who could raise the strongest beast."},"links":{"mu":"mh4pns8"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"36fd93ea-e8b8-445e-b836-358f02b3d33d","name":{"en":"Monsters"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}}]}
