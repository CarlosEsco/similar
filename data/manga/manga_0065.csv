Dedicated Huntsmen and Huntresses battle Grimm with both customized weapons and their own \"Semblances,\" unique abilities derived from the energy of one's soul. Some warriors also utilize a crystallized energy propellant, \"Dust,\" to bestow their weapons with elemental properties. In this dangerous line of work, rigorous training is required to stay alive. To that end, each of Remnant's four Kingdoms have established schools to properly groom children holding aspirations of becoming licensed Huntsmen.\n\nAt Beacon Academy in the Kingdom of Vale, a promising group of future Huntresses make their debut as Team RWBY. Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, and Yang Xiao Long each come from different backgrounds and often butt heads as a result. However, when they cooperate, they are a formidable force who have even attracted the attention of Beacon's headmaster Professor Ozpin. Alongside fellow students such as those in Team JNPR, the young prodigy Ruby and her friends engage in adventures which pit them against an extremist Faunus group known as the White Fang.

All they want is for him to not further \"dirty\" the family name, by staying silent and not standing out in public. But at his new high school, Midori is surprised by the kindness of the other Planet children, particularly Yuudai Jupiter, who takes Midori under his wing on the first day. Will attending the Planetary Academy mark the beginning of a change in Midori's life, or is there no hope for him after all?"},"links":{"al":"49433","ap":"planetary","kt":"7598","mal":"19433","mu":"50805"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"josei","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}}]}

Oshikouji Ryu is 17 years old, and is called 'Genius swordman, Dragon of Kyouto'. He will inherit the property of the noble Oshikouji family, but prefers practising Kendou. He enters a school for training Kendou swordman, but the seniors of school are very harsh and intolerable. But Ryu doesn't surrender and overcomes the problems, later on he impresses his seniors and they begin to like him.\n\nKosuzu, a geisha in Gion, is Ryu's childhood friend. Ryu and Kosuzu love each other, but Ryu's uncle Takuma came in between and made Kosuzu his second wife. But their lives were still tied together, through Kyouto and the Japanese Imperialism. Tatsuru Tei, sent to Toukyou because of her family's debt, meets Ryu by accident. Ryu and his friends save her from a drunken mob, and Ryu teaches her never to give up even when the situation seems hopeless. She later becomes housemaid of an Oshikouji resident. When Ryu becomes a senior in school, he and Tatsuru fall in love. He tells his father he wants to marry Tei, but Kazuma (Ryu's father) will only allow him to marry her and return home after he earns 100 Yen (present value being about 2,500$). So Ryu searches for a job, but that's not easy as the Great Depression makes life very hard...\n\nThis manga tells a great story against the richly textured background of historical Japan and China, it has a refined and excellent artwork. Murakami's views on Chinese and Korean people is very warm, and not those of the previous invader and governor such as the extreme right party in Japan. Another interesting part of the manga is its rich depiction of Japanese colorful life. A typical example of the realistic style and a manga of high reputation in Korea and Japan."},"links":{"al":"73145","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B074BDS9YR?binding=kindle_edition\u0026ref_=dbs_s_ks_series_rwt_tkin\u0026qid=1674585063\u0026sr=1-1","bw":"series/125902/list","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/108382/","mu":"bby2mvd"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"0a39b5a1-b235-4886-a747-1d05d216532d","name":{"en":"Award Winning"}},{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"799c202e-7daa-44eb-9cf7-8a3c0441531e","name":{"en":"Martial Arts"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

Misono is a rather superstitious girl who decides to test this out on Tohno-sensei, a young teacher she has a crush on. Unfortunately for her, she makes a mistake in the attempt to surprise him and instead kisses her fellow classmate Shindou. Of course this would be the time for the legend to work quite literally as Misono’s spirit enters Shindou’s body.  \n  \n- Genseika (Primeval Flower)  \nChiya goes to school with her friends and witnesses one of them die suddenly as a flower bursts out of him. The three friends had been together since elementary school, the death hitting Chiya and Yutaka hard. When other people begin dying from the flowers, they investigate possible reasons for such usual deaths.
