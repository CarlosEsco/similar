While filling her world with whispers of love, the romantic, dissolute prince turned a blind eye to the misdeeds of several other concubines, which includes framing her for adultery, disfiguring her, as well as imposing an extreme penalty against her. When she opens her eyes again, instead of travelling through time, she is reborn as a drop-dead gorgeous lady. In possession of vast wealth and surrounded by all sorts of good-looking men, she decides that she will no longer keep her nose clean. As for that liar, Prince Xuan, should still put on a show of love and affection in front of her?\n\n---\nWhen she woke up, she realized that she had transmigrated into the bed of Prince Xuan and mysteriously become his bedside maid. The prince, who's an unloyal playboy, tells her that he loves her everyday, but at the same time he allows her to be mistreated. He even watches as she is accused of cheating on him and is disfigured before being drowned to death. When she awakes once more, she is back in the present with a pretty face. Having been reborn, she no longer cares for being mediocre. With delicious food and drinks in one hand, and dozens of dollar bills on her other hand, she is surrounded by beautiful men as she lives a lavish and excessive life. That is until the lying man shows up one day claiming to still be in love with her. Is he lying, or is he being honest for once?\n\n---\n  **Original Web Comic:** [BiliBili](https://manga.bilibili.com/detail/mc24426?utm_source=mgd\u0026utm_medium=uploader)\n**Official English Translations:** [WebComicsApp](https://www.webcomicsapp.com/comic/5db6daba8c252b6ddd13a602), [Flying Lines](https://www.flying-lines.com/comic/rebirth-the-turnabout-of-a-mistreated-concubine)"},"links":{"al":"122999","engtl":"https://www.bilibilicomics.com/detail/mc360?utm_source=mgd\u0026utm_medium=uploader","mu":"170486","raw":"https://ac.qq.com/Comic/ComicInfo/id/624475"},"originalLanguage":"zh","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"0bc90acb-ccc1-44ca-a34a-b9f3a73259d0","name":{"en":"Reincarnation"}},{"id":"292e862b-2d17-4062-90a2-0356caa4ae27","name":{"en":"Time Travel"}},{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"aafb99c1-7f60-43fa-b75f-fc9502ce29c7","name":{"en":"Harem"}},{"id":"ace04997-f6bd-436e-b261-779182193d3d","name":{"en":"Isekai"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e197df38-d0e7-43b5-9b09-2842d0c326dd","name":{"en":"Web Comic"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}},{"id":"f5ba408b-0e7a-484d-8d49-4e9125ac96de","name":{"en":"Full Color"}}]}

Kagami is an empath who can feel the emotions of others. This incredible ability is a mystery unto itself.\n\nThe stirring tale of these two outrageous and irrepressible individuals and their eccentric clients begins here!\n\n---\nMoguri is an unlicensed detective agency that accepts clients other agencies refuse. Its main employees are Kagami Kizuna and Midou Maya, two handsome young men who look nothing like private investigators. Despite their appearances and somewhat questionable behaviour, the pair is surprisingly adept at solving cases. In pursuit of the truth, they may in fact uncover more than they are asked to. This is due to Kizuna's secret skill—he is an \"empath,\" able to share in the emotions of the people around him.\n\nKizuna's power goes above and beyond that of others who also call themselves empaths. By \"linking\" with another person, he is able to take on their talents and even perform feats that would normally be impossible for him. However, after taking advantage of this ability, it is difficult for Kizuna to come back to himself. It is a sobering reality that one day he might lose sight of his own personality - but this is an outcome that Maya, who has been by Kizuna's side since high school, is determined to avoid.\n\n---\n**Original Web Publication:** [Comic DAYS](https://comic-days.com/episode/3269754496444849820), [ZERO-SUM Online](https://zerosumonline.com/zerosum/comic/kareniirai)","ja":"正規の探偵が受けることのできない仕事を引き受けるモグリの探偵、鏡キズナと相棒の御堂眞矢。鏡は人の感受性を強く受け取ることのできる「エンパス」だが、その能力はさらに不可思議な謎を持っていた。破天荒かつ陽気な二人が癖のある依頼人たちと巻き起こす物語が開幕――！\n\n---\n**Original Web Publication:** [Comic DAYS](https://comic-days.com/episode/3269754496444849820), [ZERO-SUM Online](https://zerosumonline.com/zerosum/comic/kareniirai)"},"links":{"al":"104060","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/4758033730/","ap":"kare-ni-irai-shite-wa-ikemasen","bw":"series/168304","cdj":"https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/searchuni?term.media_format=\u0026q=彼に依頼してはいけません","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/468605/","kt":"53155","mal":"113578","mu":"147486","raw":"https://comic-days.com/episode/3269754496444849820"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"josei","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}}]}

The small number of people gifted with magical potential are trained and then placed into a special government agency as a magic enforcer. Technology has allowed us to bring back the dead if another life is sacrificed. If the court deems it appropriate, a murderer’s life would be sacrificed to revive the victim. However, during this resurrection process, the revived person, called the Returner, comes back with a psychological problem called the Bug where negative emotions such as jealousy, revenge or anger become amplified. If left alone, the Returner becomes consumed in this emotion and, eventually, it will physically manifest itself in the form of a dangerous monster. The true role of the magic enforcer is to eliminate that Bug.  \n  \nNagumo Kento, codenamed Deep Searcher, is a seasoned magic enforcer whose role is \"Searcher\" in where he draws out the evil using his unique power. His brand new partner, Amagi Yoko, codenamed Evil Eater, is a rookie who recently graduated from the academy as a prodigy, even by magic user’s standards. Her job as \"Debugger\" is to use her power to dispose of the evil that Kento brings out and even the experienced members of the magic enforcers are shocked by Yoko’s power. Together, Kento and Yoko work against the seeds of evil to allow Returners to enjoy their second chance at life.

Don't miss the gripping action with Jun Manjome and Yuriko Edogawa.\n\n≪Description of the work≫.\n\nIn 1966, when the penetration rate of black-and-white televisions exceeded 90%, TBS's \"Ultra Q\" which began airing in January, quickly became a popular program with viewer ratings in the 30% range. Until then, the program offered free weekly encounters with Tsuburaya's monsters, which could only be seen in movie theaters during spring and summer vacations. \n\nIt was no wonder that children waited 1001 days for the Sunday night 7:00 p.m. broadcast. In the publishing world, which is sensitive to the anticipation of the times, Kodansha was the first to recognize the potential of \"Ultra Q\". Ten months before the TV broadcast, the company began serializing the manga in the monthly magazine \"Bokura\". \n\nAfter the initial serialization it was subsequently ceded to a rival, Shueisha's Shonen Book took on the challenge of the first comicalization in its spring vacation extra issue a year later. The first volume, \"I Saw a Bird\" was drawn by Ken Nakajo, who later established his own era with a series of martial arts manga. The magazine received overwhelming support from readers, and Ken Nakajo also published his new drawings in a large-format book called \"komix\" at the time. \n\nMany of the 10 chapters created by Nakajo are long stories with few page restrictions, and they can be said to be a model for TV Manga adaptations.\n\n[Additional Info](http://blog.livedoor.jp/godzitoraman/archives/1002414.html)"},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E6%98%AD%E5%92%8C%E3%81%AE%E3%83%86%E3%83%AC%E3%83%93%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9F%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%83%BB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%AB%E3%83%88%E3%83%A9Q-%E4%B8%8A-%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%82%B7%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA-433/dp/4775914367/ref=monarch_sidesheet","ap":"ultra-q","cdj":"https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-1023566","mu":"cfe86pz","raw":"https://www.fukkan.com/fk/CartSearchDetail?i_no=68319835"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"36fd93ea-e8b8-445e-b836-358f02b3d33d","name":{"en":"Monsters"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"39730448-9a5f-48a2-85b0-a70db87b1233","name":{"en":"Demons"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"3bb26d85-09d5-4d2e-880c-c34b974339e9","name":{"en":"Ghosts"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"5fff9cde-849c-4d78-aab0-0d52b2ee1d25","name":{"en":"Survival"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"92d6d951-ca5e-429c-ac78-451071cbf064","name":{"en":"Office Workers"}},{"id":"b29d6a3d-1569-4e7a-8caf-7557bc92cd5d","name":{"en":"Gore"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"cdad7e68-1419-41dd-bdce-27753074a640","name":{"en":"Horror"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"e64f6742-c834-471d-8d72-dd51fc02b835","name":{"en":"Aliens"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}
