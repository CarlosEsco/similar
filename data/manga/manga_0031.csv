The little brother tries to pretend he doesn't know how his older brother feels, while the older brother wants to make his younger brother acknowledge his feelings."},"links":{"al":"62015","ap":"yagate-ao-ni-naru","kt":"4022","mal":"32015","mu":"57415"},"originalLanguage":"ja","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"5920b825-4181-4a17-beeb-9918b0ff7a30","name":{"en":"Boys' Love"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

Surely, no matter what the legend says, that obnoxious playboy could not be the man of her destiny!"},"links":{"al":"90614","ap":"hua-cao-guan-xi-close-to-you","kt":"25814","mal":"67337","mu":"76229"},"originalLanguage":"zh","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"9ab53f92-3eed-4e9b-903a-917c86035ee3","name":{"en":"Crossdressing"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}}]}

For Atsushi, Anzu is the only one who ever smiled wholeheartedly upon meeting him, but now that they have met again in high school, Anzu has changed completely. Why doesn't she smile? What can a boy–a singer–with a frightful expression and no speech do to bring her beautiful smile back…?  \n  \n2) Ding Dong  \nHappiness resounds, ding dong. Though the sound of it may be short-lived, the echo only dies if we allow it to. Chisato wonders if her father ever loved her. He died in a car accident, leaving Chisato behind with her stepmother. He never gave her anything–no gifts on holidays, and he didn't even have the decency to go on living for her. It might be the case that even Chisato's stepmother feels no love for her and will leave. But one question from Chisato's childhood friend, Takahiro, brings the past echoing back with more clarity than ever before.  \n  \n3) Voice of Mine  \nInagaki Shuu is a musical genius, the son of musical geniuses, and so the eyes that watch him as he plays the violin are not the eyes of attentive listeners, but the eyes of scrutinizing customers. People are cold to him and the technical perfection he picked up from his parents…except for Futaba, that strange girl who ran into the music room to hide while he was there and then escaped out the window. She's straight and honest in her actions–and in her music. You can hear her voice when she plays, a voice that's uniquely hers. Can she help a genius to find his own voice…?  \n  \n4) Double Flower  \nSuguru is a little strange for an 18 year-old boy. As a hobby and by profession, he's a seamstress. His rude little grade schooler step-niece, Aya, has run away from home and is staying with him now, and she lets him know everything that's on her mind without hesitation. It hurts to hear from her why women don't look on him as a man, but it also helps him understand what he needs to do to win the woman he loves…  \n  \n5) Dark Princess  \nA hilarious fairytale side story of \"Those Who Have Wings\". Once upon a time, there was a beautiful princess named Princess Shoka. She was so lovely that she was called \"Snow White,\" but she was also called \"Dark Princess\" because she was a sadistic slave driver! King Hiruto, Queen Phia, and General Tooya knew they had to do something about her behaviour, so they hired Hunter Yang to kill her!? But she escaped, with Hunter Yang as her hostage, and went on an adventurous journey to find a hot knight to be her ultimate love!"},"links":{"al":"31457","ap":"songs-to-make-you-smile","kt":"3102","mal":"1457","mu":"1082"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}}]}

At least that was his plan before a couple of abnormal creatures rented his house.  \n  \nA remote, outdated big apartment, a bunch of rather abnormal non-human creatures, and a labor contract from the “god”, the three factors combined lead him to be the busiest landlord and most supernatural “babysitter”. The story of the most complicated, erratic and abnormal landlord and tenants started from here.  \n  \n“Ever since I put my fingerprint on the labor contract, I knew I was roped into something terrible…”  \n  \nAs a person who is down-to-earth as well as a good Samaritan, Hao Ren desires to live the rest of his life as a benevolent landlord. Stumbling into a curious yet mysterious lady, he began his journey of “collecting” abnormal and supernatural tenants.  \n  \nHis life only became more chaotic when he receives a labor contract from “God”.

The most popular work in the series \"Taro\" is finally here!\n\nUltraman, the immortal hero born in Japan. Mamoru Uchiyama's version of 'Ultraman', which was serialized very popularly by 'second graders' from 1971 to 1974, will be released as a full-scale book for the first time this autumn to commemorate the 45th anniversary of Tsuburaya Productions' Ultraman Series! The third installment is the popular work \"Ultraman Taro\" (1973)! Taro, transformed by ZAT member Taro Higashiko, is very active against scary monsters. This work is the first to draw \"Ultra no Kuni\" and is a monumental masterpiece that greatly fuses the TV series and the dreams of the readers of the school yearbook. Please enjoy the Uchiyama Ultra World, which is getting more and more passionate!\nSmart and elegant character design, speedy development, and the power of dynamic battle scenes are truly unique to Mamoru Uchiyama. On that day, Taro's activities that the boys were heartbroken... are coming back after 38 years!\nThe series, which was praised as \"one of the best masterpieces\" among the many Ultraman comicalized works, was only released as a convenience store comic in the mid-2000s after being published in a magazine (already sold out), and is now difficult to obtain. It became a rare work of \"phantom\", and it was eagerly desired to be published in a cohesive form.\nDirector Shinji Higuchi is also enthusiastic! (=Recommendation comments below) A chance to have four popular masterpieces in our own “reprint request” in an affordable form. Includes the full story of the monthly magazine serialization, including all the cover art from the magazine serialization, a new interview with Mamoru Uchiyama full of creative secrets, and a mini comic \"Time Slip Graffiti My Ultra 1973\" drawn by Mamoru Uchiyama. Stay tuned!!\n\nPublisher: Fukkan.com / Planning Cooperation: Shogakukan (C) Tsuburaya Pro is not recorded this time.

One example of this troubleshooting would be that the otaku of Akiba have come under a surge of bullying. @DEEP's first task was to eliminate this bullying. After getting rid of this problem, @DEEP began taking up other tasks as well. Some of these include clearing the name of a cosplayer in a case that involved the distribution of underground videos depicting other cosplayers getting undressed in dressing rooms, protecting a news anchor from attacks by otaku who were enraged at a story that she had previously worked on that bashed the youth of Akiba, and helping out a maid cafe that the people of Akiba frequent from an opposing maid cafe that was acting extremely hostile to this maid cafe and even provided various prostitution services to the visitors of the opposing maid cafe.  \n  \nWhile @DEEP solves these cases, the group unintentionally attracts the attention of a seedy character named Nakagomi Takeshi. The reason behind this is because of a secret past relationship between Nakagomi and Yui. What adds to this is a fully self-reliant AI program that Nakagomi would greatly benefit from if he got his hands on it. This is because he is the president of a very influential electronics company called Digital Capital, often shortened to DigiCap. He will eventually raid @DEEP's headquarters, steal Yui's AI, and kidnap Akira.  \n  \nSee [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=8919) for live-action TV series.  \nSee [AnimeNewsNetwork](https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/anime.php?id=8920) for live-action move."},"links":{"al":"33316","ap":"akihabara-at-deep","kt":"7210","mal":"3316","mu":"13107"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}}]}
