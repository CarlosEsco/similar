When everyone is convinced that he is dead, Kosuke's brainwaves begin to show signs of abnormality and his body shows an amazing and instantaneous recovery. While Kosuke's change was instantaneous, and all but his miraculous recovery seemed to be due to his imagination, the professor was the only one who couldn't help but worry about Kosuke. He had seen the 'silver-haired Kosuke' nine years ago. The silver-haired Kosuke has a super brain and senses that make it hard to believe that he is a child. He has discovered that his father was killed in a fake accident and that his assistant, Kuchisaki, was responsible for the accident, and he sentenced him to death by fire.  \n  \nKosuke and Saeko go to the ruins of a school event, and the professor, who has been accompanying them to the event, runs into a thief who has stolen the materials from their house, and is trapped in a trap that he has inadvertently set. He becomes the silver-haired Kosuke again and begins to solve the mystery of the ruins. From then on, the Kobayakawa family is caught up in a battle between many organizations that are trying to obtain the secrets of the ancient ruins. Silver-haired Kosuke' becomes known as 'Silver Wolf' in the midst of this battle, and this leads to a battle with the Lorenz Foundation, the child prodigy organization that killed Kosuke's father.  \n  \nAt the same time, Kosuke's own body is also affected by the imbalance between \"Silver Wolf\" and \"Ordinary Kosuke\". Kosuke's own body cannot keep up with the silver-haired Kosuke's abilities, and this ultimately results in the overworking of his body and brain, reducing his life span. The Lorenz Foundation then launches its final operation. They plan to revive the super-ancient final weapon and exterminate the human race. Kosuke rides to the Foundation's home base to save his friends and defeat the Lord of the Foundation, albeit at a cost. When all is said and done, the silver-haired Kosuke falls into an eternal sleep with no end in sight. But once again, when his loved ones are in danger, Kosuke's silver hair will shine again."},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}}]}

It seemed all was lost until one of the heroes defeated the enemy with a powerful spell. The four heroes were able to seal this great evil to be forgotten forever - or so they thought.  \n  \nThe next scene in this story takes place years later with the children of those who sealed away the great evil. The sealing was accomplished by combining the power of two pendants. A foolish dark knight was tricked into stealing the pendants, to break the seal that conceals the great evil. He defeated the heroes and kidnapped their children. With the two pendants in hand, he broke the great evil's seal.  \n  \nA remaining hero sends the children to another time so that, maybe, the world will have another chance. What will become of the children? How could they possibly defeat someone that their parents could only seal away? Who is the great evil and what is his purpose? Only time will tell as they venture on into several strange, yet familiar worlds.  \n  \nBased on the role-playing game of the same name by Namco Tales Studio."},"links":{"al":"40738","ap":"tales-of-phantasia","kt":"20521","mal":"10738","mu":"35383"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

He brings her to the school's nurse's office. In class, a new girl comes running in shouting Shinichiro's name. She looks awfully familiar to the girl Shinichiro brought in earlier. The class leader knocks the new girl out for being to rambunctious and Shinichiro brings her to the nurse's office too and finds that there are actually two girls who look very similar. When they come around, they get officially introduced. The girl he saved in the morning is named Sawatari Arisa, the loud one is named Sawatari Alyssa. While their names are identical in pronunciation, they have no apparent relation. Shinichiro looks at Arisa and thinks she's the girl from his past as she's very bashful and shy. However, Alyssa wears the cat-ears that he remembers and she also remembers him.

Это книга под названием «Тайные знаки секты Хедон», которая была частично расшифрована 19-м лидером религиозной общины, а написана много лет назад. И содержит множество пророчеств о будущем не только нашей секты, но и мира в целом. Так или иначе, в ней написано об одновременном появлении четырех великих мастеров, Предположительно в наши дни, которые смогут положить конец мировому хаосу. Хранитель земли с Юга, борец за справедливость с Севера, Служитель Богу с Запада и мастер, идущий по пути даосизма с Востока. \"Когда триста делится пополам и пяти недостаточно, камень, находящийся в основании колоны храма, поднимется на крышу.\" Содержание пророчества написано в такой вот зашифрованной форме… Если произвести расчёт, то получается 145. И как раз-таки лидер Со является 145-м главой секты Хедон."},"links":{"mu":"yxkzw9b","raw":"https://comic.naver.com/webtoon/list?titleId=784813"},"originalLanguage":"ko","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"36fd93ea-e8b8-445e-b836-358f02b3d33d","name":{"en":"Monsters"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"39730448-9a5f-48a2-85b0-a70db87b1233","name":{"en":"Demons"}},{"id":"3bb26d85-09d5-4d2e-880c-c34b974339e9","name":{"en":"Ghosts"}},{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"a1f53773-c69a-4ce5-8cab-fffcd90b1565","name":{"en":"Magic"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"cdad7e68-1419-41dd-bdce-27753074a640","name":{"en":"Horror"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"e197df38-d0e7-43b5-9b09-2842d0c326dd","name":{"en":"Web Comic"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}},{"id":"f5ba408b-0e7a-484d-8d49-4e9125ac96de","name":{"en":"Full Color"}}]}

On a far away Earth-like planet known as O-pa, there is a civilization made entirely of women. One of them, a scientist named Lib Myura, has fallen in love with Shun. She and her two colleagues have created an illegal male human robot, called a synchroid, which they intend to fill with Shun's consciousness.\n\nHowever, things never go exactly as planned. They successfully make contact with Shun, but it isn't just his mind that the synchroid shares. Any injury the synchroid sustains is inflicted on Shun, back on Earth. What's worse, when Shun is not actively inhabiting the synchroid, it reverts to a crazy sex-crazed pervert. Things only get more complicated when Myura's illegal research is uncovered!
