The other was the Go- Majin tribe with horns on their heads, with a strong body and strong power, who took nature as an ally . The conflict between the two races threatened even the powerless other races and became extremely fierce. However, a legendary warrior who is said to wake up when evergreen is in danger is born into the shaman tribe, and the conflict ends with its power. The shaman tribe that won the battle ruled the world, and the defeated Gouma deity tribe was driven to the end of the world, ``Mt. In human terms, it was a long time ago.\n\nNow that time has passed since the battle between the two races. Shakuma , the most violent boy in Goumajin's village, wanted to \"go meet someone stronger than me\", and at the end of his desire to fight against the legendary shaman warriors, broke the village's rules and jumped out of the barrier. , I was sending days to be suppressed by the elders. However, the power of the growing Shakma has reached a critical level, whether it can be suppressed by the villagers anymore. Today as well, Shakma was locked up in a prison by the elders, but with his growing power, he broke out of the prison and escaped. Shakma was thinking of leaving the village and going to the shaman king to challenge him to a match, ignoring the troubles of the villagers . Light flew and charged towards Shakma. The true identity of the light is the beast demon girl Anes , who was magically sent to Shakuma for some reason . She was in a state of amnesia , unable to remember why she was sent away or why she was with Shakma.\n\nUnable to leave Anes crying in despair, Shakuma reluctantly took her back to the village . He sent the beast (monster) Hydra to attack Goumajin's village. Hydra was repelled by Shakuma's courage and Lovelace retreated to prepare the system, but the villagers were turned into stone by Hydra's ability, and the village was destroyed. Only the special magic of King Shaman can remove the petrification of Hydra. The elder allowed Shakma to become a messenger for the king, and Anes also accompanied Shakma on his journey to solve the \"mystery of memory\" that was hidden in himself."},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B09MJXRDST?binding=kindle_edition\u0026ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tukn","bw":"series/317857/list","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/101326/A000004063/","mu":"k2p4b5x","raw":"https://www.mangaz.com/book/detail/46191"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}}]}

The blockbuster reprint series finally reaches its climax! Uchiyama Ultraman Vol. 4 = \"Leo\", who has a lot of enthusiastic fans, is now available in a double recording of the \"2nd grader\" and \"3rd grader\" editions with double the volume!! Ultraman, an immortal hero born in Japan. Mamoru Uchiyama's version of 'Ultraman', which was serialized very popularly by 'second graders' from 1971 to 1974, will be released as a full-scale book for the first time this autumn to commemorate the 45th anniversary of Tsuburaya Productions' Ultraman Series! The fourth installment is \"Ultraman Leo\" (1974)! Leo who transforms Ootori Gen, his younger brother Astra, and Ultra Seven = Moroboshi Dan who trains Gen will save the earth! Leo and the others defeat astonishing enemies one after another, such as the legendary \"Tsuruku Rider Corps\". Please enjoy Uchiyama's ultra world with clear writing! \u003cbr\u003eThe smart and elegant character design, speedy development, and dynamic battle scenes are truly unique to Mamoru Uchiyama. On that day, Leo's success that the boys were heartbroken... is coming back after 37 years! The series, which was praised as \"one of the masterpieces\" among the many Ultraman comics, was only released as a convenience store comic in the mid-2000s after being published in a magazine (already sold out), and is now difficult to obtain. It became a rare work of \"phantom\", and it was eagerly desired to be published in a cohesive form. Director Shinji Higuchi is also enthusiastic! (=Recommendation comments below) A chance to have four popular masterpieces in our own “reprint request” in an affordable form. Includes the full story of the monthly magazine serialization, including all the cover art from the magazine serialization, a new interview with Mamoru Uchiyama full of creative secrets, and a mini comic \"Time Slip Graffiti My Ultra 1974\" drawn by Mamoru Uchiyama.

Upon arriving at her mother's house, she meets her three new beautiful siblings, all from different fathers. Her new-found family is filled with hilarious oddities, ranging from laziness to drunkenness to gay incest. She is constantly antagonized by her brothers Sumire and Aoi. And her sister Fuyou does little to help. And thus Yuri becomes little more than a maid in the household, catering to her siblings needs while her mother travels the world. But as Yuri's warmth fills the house which before had been so cold…what will happen between her and her brothers?

But underneath the sheen of perfection lurks a secret with the power to shake the world to its foundations.  \n  \nDuring a boyhood excursion to one of the southern archipelagos near Okinawa, Yuki barely survived exposure to a poison gas stored at a foreign military facility. The leakage annihilated all of the island’s inhabitants but was promptly covered up by the authorities, leaving Yuki as an unacknowledged witness—one whose sense of right and wrong, however, the potent nerve agent managed to obliterate.  \n  \nNow, fifteen years later, Yuki is a social climber of Balzacian proportions, infiltrating the worlds of finance and politics by day while brutally murdering children and women by night—perversely using his Kabuki-honed skills as a female impersonator to pass himself off as the women he’s killed. His drive, however, will not be satiated with a promotion here and a rape there. Michio Yuki has a far more ominous objective: obtaining MW, the ultimate weapon that spared his life but robbed him of all conscience.  \n  \nThere are only two men with any hope of stopping him: one, a brilliant public prosecutor who struggles to build a case against the psychopath; the other, a tormented Catholic priest, Iwao Garai, who shares Yuki’s past—and frequently his bed.\n\n[Official English](https://kodansha.us/series/mw/)\n\n---\n**Volumes 301-303 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**","it":"(amazon.it)\nNegli anni Sessanta, al largo di Okinawa, l'esercito americano e le forze di autodifesa giapponesi perdono il controllo di un'arma chimica micidiale chiamata MW.

In 1990, Human and Therian legislators launched the «Therian Human Intelligence, Recon, Defense, Squadron» aka the THIRDS, an elite, military-funded agency comprised of an equal number of Human and Therian agents.  \nBut THIRDS agents are more than a team — they’re a family through thick and thin, and along the way, some find true love. While every day brings dangers and challenges, one thing will never change: standing up for what you believe in and protecting the people you love is never optional.  \nTHIRDS exists to uphold the law for Humans and Therians without prejudice. During the Vietnam War, biological warfare spread the Melanoe virus, infecting millions worldwide and changing the course of human history forever. The vaccine, Eppione.8, created using strains from animals immune to the virus, activated a dormant mutation within the virus that altered human DNA and gave birth to a new species: Therians.  \nIn an attempt to restore social order, the US government put new regulations and laws into place, along with a Therian branch of government. In 1990, Human and Therian legislators launched the «Therian Human Intelligence, Recon, Defense, Squadron» aka the THIRDS, an elite, military-funded agency comprised of an equal number of Human and Therian agents.  \nBut THIRDS agents are more than a team — they’re a family through thick and thin, and along the way, some find true love.
