In 2007, Ikeda remarked, \"A certain mangaka depicted a spiritual romance between Prince Shotoku and Soga no Emishi. I was uncomfortable by that...\" while also stating that her take on Shotoku was one faithful to history, since it was commissioned by Shittenoji. Though not named, the mangaka in question was most likely Yamagishi.

The art in this cannot be missed!!  \n  \nConsists of four stories:  \n  \n1) Electrical Shock Love Machine:  \nMadoka, one of the most beautiful and popular girls in school, has zero interest in boys or romance. That is, until she meets Bansaku. He seems like a very average boy, unless one looks very closely… and Madoka does. She becomes so hypnotized by the little things about him that she loses her good senses, and when she regains them, she finds herself touching poor Bansaku, who has no idea what she's playing it! Madoka has spent her life dodging the unwelcome advances of desperate male love machines… Does Bansaku feel the same sort of disgust for Madoka's long-repressed, electrically-charged lust?  \n  \n2) My Baby:  \nMorimura Aki's handsome looks attract women by the thousands, but his violent manner keeps them all at arm's length. As an innocent bystander, Moe couldn't have cared less… until one of his outbursts led to her injury! Now revenge is a matter of pride. But when she exacts it, there's an unexpected result…? (No, really, you'll never guess if you don't read it!)  \n  \n3) Like in Cinderella:  \nWhen Chiyo lost her job and had to take on work picking weeds for the rich, she never expected to become like Cinderella. But when Yoshimune, the handsome young master of the Tokugawa Financial Empire, runs away from his \"castle\" with her, that's what Chiyo is certain will happen. But there's no guarantee that these two will live happily ever after, because this fairy tale isn't Cinderella's – it's Chiyo's!  \n  \n4) Don't Get Me into It:  \nNone of Ichirou's home tutors ever come back after the first tutoring session, but Takigawa Megu can't imagine why – he's so cute! And… tied down in his chair!? It turns out that Ichirou is a complete and utter brat! Megu makes it her mission to prove herself superior to him, and Ichirou is actually impressed? Now, every time he gives her an inch, he gets her a little more into it.

However, life is never so easy. Soon after reaching 6th stage in spirit novice realm cultivation, his progress stagnated due to incurring a rare medical condition.  \n  \nA few years go by, and Su Yun has spent all his time gambling or drinking, wasting his youth away, but one day everything changes. Qing Er, the only one who stood by him was forced by his clan to be a sacrificial bride to someone she didn’t love, only to be executed by the groom on the wedding night for fleeing. Burning for revenge, he scoured the world for a cure for his rare medical condition from both righteous and villainous side.  \n  \nCountless years go by, and finally Su Yun not only found a way to cure his rare condition but also gain immense knowledge on a myriad of martial techniques.  \nBut before he could fully cure himself, he received news that the groom suffered an assault that damaged his internal organs. Rather than wait for decades to become fully cured, Su Yun decided to hatch a plan for the assassinate of the groom. Unfortunately, he underestimated the strength of the groom’s family and was killed instead.  \nThen he regains consciousness. He comes to a realization that he went 15 years in the past. This time, he vowed to protect Qing Er, but first he must cure his rare medical condition.
