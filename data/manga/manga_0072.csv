When Taein is chased by Lim Gurin, who he does not reciprocate feelings for — he ends up begging Soohyuk to fake date with him in order to chase Lim Gurin away.\nSomehow, just like the tale as old as time goes — pretense somehow starts to turn into reality. However, before a \"happily ever after\" there is the process of falling in love, and the slow realization that somehow they aren't pretending anymore. Somehow, they do not want to.\n\n---\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cNaver\u003e](https://series.naver.com/comic/detail.series?productNo=6015663)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003ckakao\u003e](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=56726635)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cRidiBooks\u003e](https://ridibooks.com/books/297035197)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cMr.Blue\u003e](https://www.mrblue.com/comic/C000047211)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cLezhin\u003e](https://www.lezhin.com/ko/comic/2gether_the_series)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cComico\u003e](https://www.comico.kr/comic/2092)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cBookCube\u003e](https://www.bookcube.com/toon/detail.asp?webtoon_num=210096)","ko":"X나 잘생긴 그놈이 내 남친이 된다면…? \n\n대학에 입학한 태인은 예쁜 여자친구와의 평범하고 알콩달콩한 연애를 꿈꾼다.\n그런데 현실은 그린이라는 ‘남자’의 집요한 애정공세뿐!\n그린은 태인이 있는 곳이라면 어디든 따라오고 아무리 거절해도 포기할 줄 모른다.\n어떻게든 그린을 떼어놓고 싶은 태인은 친구들에게 도움을 요청하고\n힘겹게 한 가지 방법을 찾아낸다. \n그 방법은 바로 대학 최고의 인기남 ‘유수혁’과 사귀는 것?!\n스토커 같은 그린을 떼어내기 위해선 누가 봐도 X나 멋진 녀석과 사귀는 수밖에…\n유수혁과 사귀기 위한 차태인의 고군분투 캠퍼스 연애담이 시작된다!\n\n---\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cNaver\u003e](https://series.naver.com/comic/detail.series?productNo=6015663)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003ckakao\u003e](https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=56726635)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cRidiBooks\u003e](https://ridibooks.com/books/297035197)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cMr.Blue\u003e](https://www.mrblue.com/comic/C000047211)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cLezhin\u003e](https://www.lezhin.com/ko/comic/2gether_the_series)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cComico\u003e](https://www.comico.kr/comic/2092)\n- [Original Webtoon \u003cBookCube\u003e](https://www.bookcube.com/toon/detail.asp?webtoon_num=210096)"},"links":{"mu":"179573","raw":"https://twitter.com/6uooU/status/1387950831287234564"},"originalLanguage":"ko","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"5920b825-4181-4a17-beeb-9918b0ff7a30","name":{"en":"Boys' Love"}},{"id":"e197df38-d0e7-43b5-9b09-2842d0c326dd","name":{"en":"Web Comic"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}},{"id":"f5ba408b-0e7a-484d-8d49-4e9125ac96de","name":{"en":"Full Color"}}]}

One is unsurprised to encounter a creature that is half elderly man, half crab or a flying frog in this world where our guide apparent is an anthropomorphic, mollusk-like cat. Sakabashira weaves this absurdist tale in a seamless tapestry constructed of elements as seemingly disparate as Japanese folklore, pop culture, and surrealism.

Hoping to escape from his father's continuous proposals, Tokoha told his father that he likes men – and thus his father should give up on planning an arranged marriage for him. To convince his father, he asked the butler Asou to pretend to be his lover. At first, Tokoha slept with Asou only to deceive his father. But as time passed, he derived great pleasure from their relationship. How will the fake love between the cool butler and the young master continue?  \n  \n3: Kiss For Reward  \nTanigawa has been Arisu-sensei's student since Arisu was in college: first as a home-tutor student, and now as a student in the school where Arisu works.

After he wins the festival wrestling championship, he and Ehwa begin to meet, sneaking spare moments to be together. But a shadow falls on their romance when Master Cho sends Duksam away and asks for Ehwa’s hand in marriage himself It is then that Ehwa discovers the pain of heartbreak – and that love is always complicated.  \n  \n3. \"The Color of Heaven\": A celebration of the triumph of true love. As Ehwa grew from a girl to a young woman in The Color of Earth and The Color of Water, she began to understand and experience love and relationships, with her mother as a model and confidante.

Island (2007, Akamaru Jump)  \nFor the last 400 years, an island has been completely surrounded by walls, isolated from the rest of the world. Aira and Marue have always dreamed of voyaging outside the walls, where lies a devastating truth unbeknownst to them.  \n  \n2. Koi no Kami-sama (2007, Weekly Shonen Jump)  \nTsuchibe Taichi, a boy who loves shoujo manga and believes in love above all else, ironically has the worst luck in love. His latest attempt in love is at the new transfer student, but a strange otherworldly force seems to be repelling him from her.  \n  \n3. Williams (2007, Weekly Shonen Jump)  \nWilliam is a young boy who idolizes Aradoff, a character from a popular novel which told Aradoff's adventures, and always dreams of having a grand adventure on his own. William's meeting with the novel author finally puts him on an adventure to prove that the novel is not merely a fiction.  \n  \n4. Personant (2008, Jump SQ)  \nIn the year 3333, everyone wears personants, technologically advanced masks, to maintain equality and peace, because they eliminate the \"differences\" in people that lead to discrimination and conflict. It has been 100 years since the government implemented this \"personant system,\" so society has adapted. Yet one man exists as the only one in the world without a personant: the wanted criminal Damore!  \n  \n5. Apple (2008, Young Magazine)  \nThe main character (the blond ponytailed guy - yeah, guy) is Aramiya Satoshi, whose main ability is shape-shifting into any animal… though at some point he has plants growing out of him, so he is able shape-shift into any living thing. I'm not sure if he was naturally born that way or if he was a biological experiment. Anyway, he's a pretty easy-going guy who just wants to be left alone to enjoy his solitary life in the middle of a junkyard, but apparently some army or another is always after him because of his ability. Luckily, he is able to fight off entire tank battalions before breakfast.  \n  \n6.

According to a book I read, I'm supposed to be murdered in place of the saint, Cordelia, just because I look like her. I decided to run away to avoid ever meeting my future killer, Duke Valencia, but ended up running into him as he was on the brink of death. After I saved him in the hopes of being spared, he adopted me as his daughter! Now that my new dad's spoiling me with love, does this mean I'll get to live until the end?\n\n---\nIt's already unfair that I suffered greatly because I closely resembled the saint, but why did the villain kill me without any mercy at all? No, actually, it said in the book that I was really bound to die. 'My life is already ruined. Of all things, why do I have to be the one to die a ridiculous death?' There's still hope! I haven't met any of the characters yet so I'll just run away! But why did the villain collapse in front of me...?\n\nWith a lot of effort, I barely saved the life of the villain who was on the brink of death. But now he's saying that he wanted to adopt me as his daughter and raise me to be a saint?! Just like that, I decided to become his daughter for a few days before leaving quietly.\n\n\"My daughter is a genius. There's no child who is more angelic in this world other than my daughter.\"\n\n...I think I have coaxed my dad too well. Even the guys who originally followed the real saint started to pay attention to me. What went wrong? Aren't you guys supposed to hate me?!\n\n---\n**Original Web Novel:** [KakaoPage](https://page.kakao.com/content/55069889), [Naver](https://series.naver.com/novel/detail.series?productNo=8231327), [RidiBooks](https://ridibooks.com/books/3885006486)\n\n[Original Webtoon](https://page.kakao.com/content/59664271)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/the-villains-beloved-daughter/info)\n* [Chinese (Traditional) / 漢語](https://tw.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E6%83%A1%E5%BE%92%E7%9A%84%E5%AF%B6%E8%B2%9D%E5%A5%B3%E5%85%92/336)\n* [Indonesian / Bahasa Indonesia](https://id.kakaowebtoon.com/content/The-Villain%E2%80%99s-Beloved-Daughter/582)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/115994)\n* [Thai / ภาษาไทย](https://th.kakaowebtoon.com/content/%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%9C%E0%B8%B9%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%A5%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B3%E0%B8%84%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%82%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%A7%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%A3%E0%B9%89%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A2/392)","es":"Ya es injusto que sufrí mucho porque me parezco mucho a la Santa, pero ¿por qué el villano me mató sin piedad?No, en realidad, decía en el libro que estaba destinado a morir.'Mi vida ya está arruinada.
