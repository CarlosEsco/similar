It's a rare occasion where she's actually participating in a workplace drinking party but because of her characteristic honesty and sense of justice, she ended up ruining the mood.\n\nFeeling like she shouldn't be there anymore, she decided to not attend the after-party and was on her way back home when she was surrounded by hosts who tried to forcibly make her use their service. Just then, a man she didn't know appeared out of an expensive car and helped her out.\n\n\"You haven't changed at all, Chizuru-chan.\"\n\nAfter talking with the handsome man for a while, she learned that he is actually Tsukasa, her neighbour from when they were children. He's also now the representative for that host club so he can inherit his parents' business.\n\nWhile they were being engrossed in conversation, Chizuru shared with Tsukasa that she wanted to change herself as preparation for marriage. Hearing that, Tsukasa suggested that Chizuru help out at his host club and in exchange, he would help her get more used to men.\n\nChizuru was hesitant at first but decided to trust Tsukasa and agreed to it. Chizuru immediately began to start helping out at the club but Tsukasa's passionate touches left Chizuru unable to hide her bewilderment.\n\nSeems like the love lesson that the high-spec and possesive Tsukasa is giving to Chiziru, who is on the receiving end of his passionate love, will be a bit dangerous and filled with troubles!"},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E9%99%BD%E8%8F%AF-%E3%82%A8%E3%83%9F/dp/B09ZX7T3M5/ref=d_pd_sbs_sccl_2_2/358-9053933-1775824?pd_rd_w=0aAO6\u0026content-id=amzn1.sym.0658137e-f5cd-4a01-8903-013eee01b385\u0026pf_rd_p=0658137e-f5cd-4a01-8903-013eee01b385\u0026pf_rd_r=EWF6YXXDA42P3MWBD2PG\u0026pd_rd_wg=yfeDL\u0026pd_rd_r=05e40fee-daa8-46cd-8f27-a21f94ac081e\u0026pd_rd_i=B09ZX7T3M5\u0026psc=1","cdj":"https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-2759041","mu":"a14opv0","raw":"https://comic.pixiv.net/works/7379"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"josei","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}}]}

With the encouragement of his younger brother Goro, a young girl named Ruriko who takes care of orphans, and Rikidozan, Tai makes a successful debut. \n\nHowever, in order to become a top-class wrestler, he develops a special move called \"Knockout Q.\" \n\nIn front of him, strong opponents such as Chief Shinigami, Mr. 50 Megaton, Smiley Akatsuki, a practical judo master, and other villainous wrestlers, challenge Tai, Rikidozan and the rest of the Japanese wrestling world.\n\n Will Tai be able to defeat his opponents in the world of Japanese wrestling with \"Knockout Q\"?\n\nIt is the debut work of manga writer Ikki Kajiwara, and was serialized in Kodansha's \"Weekly Shonen Magazine\" in 1962. With art by Tatsuo Yoshida, the duo would later team up once more for \"Harris Mudan\". \n\n\"Champion Futo\" features real-life characters, including Rikidozan, the king of professional wrestling, who was a national hero at the time, as major characters, and uses scientific evidence for the special moves in \"Champion Futo\". \n\nThis technique can be seen in Kajiwara's later works as well, and \"Champion Futo\" can be regarded as a model for Kajiwara's works. \n\nAfter this work, Ikki Kajiwara went on to become a popular writer, writing many masterpieces such as \"Tommorow's Joe\", \"Star of the Giants\", and \"Karate Master\".\n\nAlso adapted into a very popular J-Drama, link to the series box set on Amazon **[here.](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E7%94%A6%E3%82%8B%E3%83%92%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A9%E3%82%A4%E3%83%96%E3%83%A9%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC-%E7%AC%AC32%E9%9B%86-%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%94%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3%E5%A4%AA-%E3%82%B3%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BADVD-%E3%83%87%E3%82%B8%E3%82%BF%E3%83%AB%E3%83%AA%E3%83%9E%E3%82%B9%E3%82%BF%E3%83%BC%E7%89%88/dp/B07KPJBTSP)**"},"links":{"al":"140090","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%83%81%E3%83%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%83%94%E3%82%AA%E3%83%B3%E5%A4%AA%E3%80%94%E5%AE%8C%E5%85%A8%E7%89%88%E3%80%95-%E3%80%901%E3%80%91-%E3%83%9E%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AC%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A7%E3%83%83%E3%83%97%E3%82%B7%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%82%BA-48-%E6%A2%B6%E5%8E%9F/dp/4775910973/ref=monarch_sidesheet","cdj":"https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-363856","mu":"9qkbddp","raw":"https://order.mandarake.co.jp/order/detailPage/item?itemCode=1172527680"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"5fff9cde-849c-4d78-aab0-0d52b2ee1d25","name":{"en":"Survival"}},{"id":"69964a64-2f90-4d33-beeb-f3ed2875eb4c","name":{"en":"Sports"}},{"id":"799c202e-7daa-44eb-9cf7-8a3c0441531e","name":{"en":"Martial Arts"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"92d6d951-ca5e-429c-ac78-451071cbf064","name":{"en":"Office Workers"}},{"id":"b1e97889-25b4-4258-b28b-cd7f4d28ea9b","name":{"en":"Philosophical"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"da2d50ca-3018-4cc0-ac7a-6b7d472a29ea","name":{"en":"Delinquents"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

Each of his gothic tales is exquisitely crafted with elegant detailed illustrations that transport readers into an enchanted world of gothic glory.  \n  \nIn his first story, Glass Magic, Suzuki-san does a twisted take on the classic Cinderella tale. An ugly corpse-like servant girl wishes to fall in love with a prince and become a beautiful princess. Then a sinister old witch offers her a magic potion that can grant her heart's desires, but in order for the magic to work, she must abandon her soul. She gets rid of her memories, her face, and her master to become a cruelly beautiful glass princess.  \n  \nIn another of Suzuki's splendidly dark tales, the shop keeper of an enchanted barbershop attends to his beautiful victim under the moonlight. He snips away at her thoughts and memories, mystically cutting away all her painful memories that scar her heart. However, because she is sapped of her thoughts and memories, all that is left is her pitiful vacuous body.  \n  \nPrepare to be mesmerized by Yasushi Suzuki's spine-chilling tales of love and entrancement this fall 2008, because this enchanting collection of spellbinding illustrations and twisted tales is a must-have!"},"links":{"mu":"34610"},"originalLanguage":"ja","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"cdad7e68-1419-41dd-bdce-27753074a640","name":{"en":"Horror"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

Then, you'll find all sorts of crazy developments happening, and it'll look like it's all going to end up a huge mess, but as the story charges towards the ending it'll make you want to stand up and clap your hands.   \n  \nThere are a number of habits that Sugimura Shinichi has in his images, however they're also humorous and have a personality to them that you'll never forget.

This puzzling enemy force has appeared frequently and without warning in many areas across the world. The weapons of the Neuroi mostly take on forms similar to propeller aircraft but their most troubling tactic is the spreading of a corrosive miasma. Not only do normal humans have no defense against this miasma, but the remnants of the land affected by it are processed by the Neuroi into new weapons, crumbling huge sections of former nations into the sea. As the miasma seems to be unable to spread across large bodies of water, humanity has designated such areas as their main lines of defense.  \n  \nIn order to bring out their potential for use in battle, each Witch equips a unique machine onto their legs: the Striker Unit. With the Striker Unit equipped, they gain the ability to fly and their tapped magical potential provides the strength to utilize weapons far too heavy and powerful for a normal man. Also created is a defensive field that can protect the Witches from the Neuroi's miasma as well as other physical weaponry, making them humanity's trump card in the war. The franchise's main media focuses on the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, spearheading the counterattack in war-torn Europe."},"links":{"al":"38979","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B07571R8TZ","ap":"strike-witches-maidens-in-the-sky","bw":"series/1061/list","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/126057/","engtl":"https://sevenseasentertainment.com/series/strike-witches/","kt":"18236","mal":"8979","mu":"23055"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"50880a9d-5440-4732-9afb-8f457127e836","name":{"en":"Mecha"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}}]}

Terrified of something terrible crawling towards her, she opens her eyes and sees the face of a beautiful girl. She would wake up screaming in pain as she was stabbed in the chest by sharp, sharp fangs. Angel's roommate, Agatha, on the other hand, was a wild girl, sneaking out of the academy at night. She went out to meet her boyfriend, so Angel always left the window open for her. But when morning came, Agatha had not returned. Instead of Agatha, Lilibeth, a girl as beautiful as a flower, appeared on the scene. As if seeing through Angel's attraction to her beauty, Lilibeth invites her into her room. *I've missed you so much, Angel.* Lilibeth embraces Angel and tries to take her lips with her own, whispering unexpected words. Angel was surprised and ran back to her room, but Agatha, who had disappeared, was back there.

When the emperor learned of her magic skills, he summoned her to work for him. Sadly, “work” in the emperor’s definition meant being locked up in a magic tower to be treated worse than a slave and used as a tool. One day, after 10 long years of misery, Ridel cries herself to sleep while rueing the day she revealed her barrier magic. She silently wishes that she could go back to her 18th birthday and change her life. Magically, this wish does come true and Ridel wakes up back at home on the day of her 18th birthday. Upon realizing that she had returned to the past, she vows to live a life free of magic and becomes a maid at a count’s estate. Unfortunately, her dream of living a peaceful life comes crashing down when she sees the estate’s butler, Graham, who has the exact same facial features as the emperor in her previous life. Is she doomed to never escape the grasp of the emperor, or is this just some crazy coincidence?\n\n---\nI’m Lydel Cross. When I turned 18 the Emperor trapped me in a magical tower and used me in whatever way he saw fit. That was the life I lived before it was rewound. In order to be happy during my second chance at life, I decided to turn away from anything related to magic, even becoming the maid of a count. At least, that’s how it was supposed to be…\n\n“You’re the only person I have! Please steal him from Milena! I beg of you!”\n\nWait a moment, master.
