During that time, the younger sister Dalhee became a Moon Fairy. To become a true god, she must reincarnate a certain number of times, but she's never been able to successfully live out her lives. Bored of her life in heaven, she looked down Iseugkyung to look for any troubles in the human world!  \n  \n\"Please help me… I want to die…\"  \n  \n After hearing a sad voice coming from Iseugkyung, she discovered a beautiful girl begging the Grim Reaper to leave her world. Soon after, the Grim Reaper came to take her life. Full of curiosity, Fairy Dalhee went down Iseugkyung and into the hospital room of the human girl.  \n  \nThe woman who begged to die was surrounded by many people, and told Dalhee about her finace, Jiwan, who wasn't even a bit affectionate towards her.   \n  \nHe didn't have a hint of compassion, despite learning that his fiancee was on the brink of death. It was surprising that this kind of person was alive on earth, rather than staying stuck in hell.   \n  \nWho is Dalhee? Is she not a kind and beautiful fairy?  \n  \nWith the thoughts of guiding the spirit to the afterlife, Dalhee decided to live her life as a human without the permission of the Jade Emperor. Her unauthorized reincarnated life begins now.   \n  \nDespite impulsively making up her mind to save the man with a dark soul, Dalhee discovers its quite hard living as a human. Her life is already in tatters due to her fiance, but her younger sister and step mother do their best to make her life even worse. How will she make these humans more humane?   \n  \nThere's a long way to go, but should we start with the fiancee?   \n  \nA Heavenly Fairy vs. Trashy Humans  \nThe Fairy's Trash Clean Up Project starts now!"},"links":{"al":"122045","ap":"lucky-spring-day","mu":"169062","raw":"https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=55085796"},"originalLanguage":"ko","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"0bc90acb-ccc1-44ca-a34a-b9f3a73259d0","name":{"en":"Reincarnation"}},{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"e197df38-d0e7-43b5-9b09-2842d0c326dd","name":{"en":"Web Comic"}},{"id":"f5ba408b-0e7a-484d-8d49-4e9125ac96de","name":{"en":"Full Color"}}]}

Nothing gives him more pleasure than corrupting that which is pure, and… Ayuna is pure.  \n  \nStory 2) Steal My Body Away/ Your Heart, Your Person  \nTerumi and Kazu have been sleeping together at hotels, but the relationship is entirely physical. Can it be called love? This is when Terumi suddenly meets Kyuuji, an intense young stranger who boldly uses her to escape a fight.

That's why she despises herself for drinking too much at a party one night and sleeping with the student body president, Kazuomi. He's a devil and a genius who publicly wears an angel's mask, and he tells Natsuki that if she doesn't want her boyfriend to know about her drunken infidelity, then she'll continue sleeping with him in secret. The secret is in danger of being exposed, however, when Kazuomi joins the tennis club. No, not that secret – Natsuki's OTHER secret.  \n  \nStory 4) Painful Love  \nEveryone is a little afraid of Ryuuichirou.

By infecting humans with its bite, the monster can create aggressive and undead creatures known as Kabane. On the island Hinomoto, located in the far east, people have built stations to shelter themselves from these creatures. People access the station, as well as transport wares between them, with the help of a locomotive running on steam, called Hayajiro. Ikoma, a boy who lives in the Aragane station and helps to build Hayajiro, creates his own weapon called Tsuranukizutsu in order to defeat the creatures. One day, as he waits for an opportunity to use his weapon, he meets a girl named Mumei, who is excused from the mandatory Kabane inspection. During the night, Ikoma meets Mumei again as he sees Hayajiro going out of control. The staff on the locomotive has turned into the creatures. The station, now under attack by Kabane, is the opportunity Ikoma has been looking for.  \n\n\n---\n\n","ru":"\"Стимпанк история\" расскажет о том, как можно выжить в островной стране Хиномото, спрятавшись за высокими стенами крепостей, являющимися своеобразными станциями, от зомбиподобных существ со стальными сердцами, которых называют кабанэ. Связь между станциями поддерживается посредством курсирующих между ними бронированных локомотивов, под названием \"Хаядзиро\". Икома, молодой ремесленник, помогающий строить Хаядзиро, создает на станции оружие, названное \"пронзателем\", позволяющее уничтожать кабанэ. Однажды, ожидая возможности применить оружие, он встречает загадочную, безымянную девушку.
