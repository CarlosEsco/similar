The Prince sees the grim state of the dried-up town and report on it, but Arshtat scorns this; she declares that Lordlake's citizens deserve their desolation for stealing the Dawn Rune. Arshtat's husband Ferid pulls her back to her senses, and she dismisses the inspection party with a whisper.  \n  \nThe next issue of contention is the Sacred Games for Princess Lymsleia's hand in marriage, being held somewhat early for the ten-year old Lymsleia. The two main contestants, both representing themselves with a champion, hail from rival noble houses: The foppish Euram Barows, and Sialeeds' former fiance, the charismatic Gizel Godwin. The royal family, however, favors the mysterious outsider Belcoot, as a neutral option less likely to cause strife; the Prince attempts to aid Belcoot quietly with Ferid's approval. However, Gizel successfully rigs the Games to his advantage, and his champion Childerich defeats a drugged Belcoot while the Barow's champion is disqualified.  \n  \nHowever, Lord Marscal Godwin, Gizel's father, is less than impressed with Gizel's activities, thinking that he has made an enemy of the Prince and the royal family as a whole with his plotting. Additionally, the royal family took Zegai, the Barows champion, into their own personal custody, who could perhaps help reveal the Godwins cheating and offer an excuse to annul the engagement. Thus, the Godwins launch a preemptive attack at the engagement ceremony in Sol-Falena, Falena's capital. Arshtat and Ferid had anticipated and prepared for the attack, but not the involvement of the elite Nether Gate assassins, who overwhelm the palace's defenses. The struggle culminates in Arshtat and Ferid's deaths, while Lymsleia finds herself a captive. The Prince Ardil, Lyon, Georg, and Sialeeds are forced to flee.  \n  \nVolume 2 Contains 2 Side Stories/Oneshots:  \n\u003e The Secret by Fujuu Mizuki (can also be found in Suikoden 5 Anthology as the 14th story)  \n\u003e The Light that Falls in the Distance"},"links":{"mu":"36527"},"originalLanguage":"ja","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

One is a knight, and the other is a wizard. And just like in the game, Makoto becomes the \"princess\"! In order to save Princess Makoto from the wicked wizard, the cool knight Nanase begins living with her!?  \n  \n2) The Fallen Angel (Tenshi Tsuiraku)  \nThis is a secret: Heaven is a company, and angels are its employees! Hashiba is just a beginning angel in the death department, so she spends most of her time on earth. She's very excited when she receives her first assignment–until it turns out that the soul she's supposed to take to heaven is that of Toujou-kun, a human boy who's always been nice to her. She doesn't want him to die… Is this the beginning of an angel falling?  \n  \n3) Moonlight The Shine of Love (Tsuki no Hikari, Koi no Kagayaki)  \nA tremendous force pulls moon fairy Kouya down to earth, but when she finds the boy responsible, he claims he did nothing to draw her to him and tells her to go home. But Kouya is literally stuck to Takimoto Sui and can't go home as long as he has a wish to see something and it remains not granted. What is the wish that lonely Sui is keeping locked inside, that was so powerful it reached as far as the moon?  \n  \n4) Program in Love (Koi Suru Program)  \nYear 2487, Kirika is 16 years old, and it's high time she got married. Not exactly enamored with the idea, she runs away from her wealthy home, only to land herself in bigger trouble with a group of hoodlums! And the only one who can save her is…walking away!? Konoe is a mercenary with a sci-fi secret who'll only help Kirika for money! (So it's a good thing Kirika has some.) She purchases him for three days, but when Konoe goes above and beyond the call of duty, Kirika gets in the mood to…*cough*…install his hardware in her system!  \n  \n5) A Love Fragrant with Kisses (Kisu de Kaoru Koi)  \nHikari wants to know all there is to know about kissing, and she wants her teacher to teach her! She has a million different wishes, so it's a lucky thing that she stumbles upon a magic lamp! But what's wrong with the genie Izumi? He's so unenthusiastic, and kind of a jerk.

Akira wakes up in a hotel room… and why does the guy seem to know him?  \n  \n2. Those That Emerged From The Night  \nThis is a story about the boss from ch. 1, before he opened his gallery.  \nYahiro Morishita is a genius painter who forages famous paintings, just from seeing them once. An introduction to a man named Kaji, an opportunity, and an old \"childhood friend\", triggers a series of events that makes the old saying \"you reap what you sow\" comes true when he finds himself tied up in the trunk of a car and almost dropped in the bay.  \n  \n3. The Day Rain Fell from the Sky  \nThis story involves Yahiro and Kaji from the previous chapter. This time, they're involved in a messy case of inheritance with a recently deceased famous painter named Tsuge, his money grubbing wife, and her son. But how does Shibata-san, the Tsuge family's servant, play into all this, and who is his loyalty for?  \n  \n4. Tangerine  \nIn a warm, orange-colored illusion, the abandoned son of a writer and the man who loves his father find friendship together…  \n  \n5. Fenced-in Boys  \nTana and Ichinose go to Ryoukufuu High, an all-boys boarding school. Ichinose is known around the school as \"gay boy\" because he'll go for anyone (boy or girl) who's cute… and Tana fits the bill.

However, playboy Yabe seems to have been after Motoko for quite a while and will have no other. Yuri might have to taste the same medicine she gave another friend a while ago–a choice between love and friendship. Meanwhile, Motoko displays no interest in Yabe, but might secretly like him. As Yuri is drawn into a friendship with Yabe, Motoko, and Hirao, she begins to learn the horrible truth between Yabe, Motoko, and her dead sister Kanako and a terrible past that will never be fixed.  \nMuroi has a suitor of her own: Sho Hirao, the student body president.

Nii-chan'' has been made into a book for the first time! You can't talk about Hisashi Sekiya without reading this work! \n\nSynopsis: Daisaku Kagami, a new teacher at a small elementary school on a small island, is a kind-hearted yet strong Superman. All of his students call him Fight Sensei because of his habit of saying \"Fight!\" One day during recess, Kagami notices students playing baseball with sticks and stones and warns them that it is dangerous, but he remembers how poor the school is, where they can't afford even science materials, and warns them sternly. He can't do it. Feeling sorry for himself, Kagami plans to buy baseball equipment with the money he gets from selling his singing glove, which is full of his memories, but...\n\nDescription: This work, which was serialized in Shogakukan's school year magazine for about two years starting in 1961, is about Kagami, a new teacher who has been assigned to an elementary school on an isolated island, and the struggle of the students who are injected with a fighting spirit into Kagami. It's a story about growing up. Kajo, like Superman, solves a series of problems such as poor school management, a murderer hiding on the island, and people in the city who threaten the island's beautiful nature. I'm sure there are many Sekiya fans who like Yuichi Nango, the main character of \"Hi-chan'', as an adult. When it comes to school dramas, people tend to think of him as \"hot-blooded,'' but this work is written in a light and fun way, and you'll be able to get a feel for Hisashi Sekiya's true character. We hope you enjoy this masterpiece, which is no wonder why it won the Shogakukan Manga Award."},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/s?k=ファイト先生\u0026i=digital-text\u0026crid=2338HUVCSEWJY\u0026sprefix=ファイト先生%2Cdigital-text%2C280\u0026ref=nb_sb_noss","bw":"series/316980/list"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"0a39b5a1-b235-4886-a747-1d05d216532d","name":{"en":"Award Winning"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}}]}
