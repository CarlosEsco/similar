At the age of seven, his family moves into an apartment complex and becomes neighbors with Saguru Matsunae. Saguru soon becomes Shinobu's 'onii-san' that he goes to for advice throughout the years. Shinobu, now seventeen, is clueless about anything involving relationships or his own body and Saguru offers to teach him…  \n  \n2) Sawaki's Case  \nHideya Katsumata and Makoto Sawaki have been friends since entering high school, but Makoto has been hiding his true feelings towards his best friend for all that time. He believes his feelings will forever go unrequited as there's no way Hideya will ever fall in love with another man. When Makoto stumbles across Shinobu and Saguru (from the previous story) kissing, he starts to believe otherwise.  \n  \n3) Love Snatcher  \nAfter getting fired from his job half Japanese Tanaka Tatsuaki drunkenly prays to the moon to take him away, and it does!

Keiichi's become a mother to the youngsters, but his relationship with their father is much more complex…"},"links":{"al":"32077","ap":"yokubou-shounen","kt":"4310","mal":"2077","mu":"3248"},"originalLanguage":"ja","contentRating":"erotica","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"5920b825-4181-4a17-beeb-9918b0ff7a30","name":{"en":"Boys' Love"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}}]}

When I started serializing this work, \nHisashi Sekiya didn't have a car or a license, and there wasn't much information available, so when he went to great lengths to research cars, he became a car enthusiast. This work's depiction of racing and the way the main character fights can be said to be the prototype for later full-fledged racing manga such as \"Inazuma Yaro'' and \"Barbara!! Racer.'' Also, \"Stop! Nii-chan'' and \"Banzai Tanteichou\".\nYou can see how much of an influence ``Shonen No. 1'' had on Sekiya 's later works from the depiction of carracing.\nThis time, in response to many reprint requests, we have reprinted all 6 volumes of previously published books.

But since he's an utter twit, he ends up crashing the car. To make it short, Kusuo arrives and beats the crap out of his younger brother, who is saved only when Isao intervenes.\n\nLater at his part-time job, Jigorou then somehow gets himself stuck in a mess when he agrees to challenge Hideki 'Guillotine' Okada in a little driving duel. He rushes off to buy a car for the duel with his savings, but finds that out of 500,000 yen, he's only got 50,000 yen left in his account after having to pay for the repairs to Kusuo's car. As expected, the poor boy spazzes and Kusuo takes pity on him and takes him to a junkyard, where Jigorou ends up buying a S13 Silvia.\n\nThanks to the new car, Jigorou ends up impressing everyone at the duel with his 'super playboy technique' drifting, including one very pretty Chinatsu Honda."},"links":{"al":"157509","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B077L2T5W5?binding=kindle_edition\u0026ref_=dbs_s_ks_series_rwt_tkin\u0026qid=1686604361\u0026sr=1-1","bw":"series/17709/list","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/248337/","mu":"t7ak5to"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"69964a64-2f90-4d33-beeb-f3ed2875eb4c","name":{"en":"Sports"}},{"id":"da2d50ca-3018-4cc0-ac7a-6b7d472a29ea","name":{"en":"Delinquents"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

Ecchi to the point that the compilation in March 2005 was jokingly advertised as Square-Enix's first adult manga.  \n  \nMika ni Harassment: In the first story, Mika makes a wish on a mirror in order to change the world into one where boys don't have ecchi thoughts when they look at girls. In the second story, Mika's school falls under the control of a misogynic dog who hates high school girls (which includes Mika). Finally, in the third story, Mika raises the ire of six-year-old child genius, Kokoa, who forces Mika to attend kindergarten again.  \nKasumi Otoko no Ko: A story about a girl called Kasumi who is a tomboy. One day, Kasumi's friend, Haruna, gives Kasumi a Chinese doll that supposedly houses an ancient Chinese goddess of femininity. Kasumi drops the doll into a ditch, which causes the doll to seek revenge on Kasumi.  \nMahou Shoujo Rukana: A story about a boy named Shuuichi, who has a special power that lets him communicate with animals. One day, Shuuichi moves in with a scientist who wants to study Shuuichi's special abilities. Also, the scientist's daughter is a magical girl called Rukana.
