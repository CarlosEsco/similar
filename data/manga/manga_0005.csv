Originally created as a companion piece to the Space Battleship Yamato Anime (also called a \"Manga Movie\" at the time by Matsumoto and other staff) which Matsumoto was also directing at the time.   \n  \n In the year 2199 humanity has found itself in a losing battle against a ruthless alien species known as the Gamilans. Forced to live underground after constant bombardment and irreparable damage done to the surface, humanity lives constantly on the defensive, every victory a pyrrhic one. Suddenly, Earth receives a transmission from the Queen of the planet Iscandar who offers humanity a device that can restore the Earth to the verdant image it once possessed.   \n  \n Using the schematics detailed in the transmission, Earth retrofits an old warship, the Yamato, now suited for space travel and Earth's last ditch effort. With a ragtag crew and one heckuva determined captain, they set out for Iscandar hoping to acquire the device that will make Earth, Earth once again. Their maiden voyage does not go unnoticed, however, and Fuhrer Dessler, the worshipped leader of the Gamilans, seeks to interrupt their trip at sea.   \n  \n Dealing with hostile forces, a short staffed crew, and various technical complications, the Yamato and its crew must brave the dangers and the treachery if Earth is to live to see another day.  \n  \nPlease support the official release.

The intensity is comparable to that of \"The Silent Fleet\"! If you love military, history and care about the future, you can't miss it! In June 1989, Morrell, an American journalist, was in Tiananmen Square looking for subjects and mingling with the students in order to cover this once-in-a-lifetime student event in Chinese history. However, on June 4, the square, which was full of forward-looking energy, turned into a bloody and brutal killing field ……! Professors who were baptized by the Cultural Revolution, brothers who were guards at the square and protesting students, top Chinese officials such as Zhao Ziyang, Deng Xiaoping, Yao Yilin and Li Peng, as well as the U.S. government, Taiwan and the world, use a mixture of fiction and reality, together with rigorous historical evidence, to portray the premature arrival of the democratic wave in China from the perspective of all walks of life, the coldest summer of 1989. It has been 17 years since the Tiananmen Square Incident, which has had a huge impact on democratic thinking in modern China and which cannot be ignored in the analysis of the Chinese economy, took place in 1989. Although many written records have been published, no pictorial works have ever been created with this event as the main axis. Since the creators in Hong Kong, China, are unable to create such a theme due to political factors, and the creators in the United States and Japan are not clear about the circumstances, we are the only ones left in the world who can challenge the theme of \"Tiananmen Incident\". Therefore, we tried to reinterpret the \"Tiananmen Incident\", an event that brought a great impact to China and the world, by using the most easily understood and impressive comic book technique. The book is divided into four chapters, each presenting a comprehensive and objective analysis of the Tiananmen Incident in four directions: general, student, senior government, and world.

Named \"Persia,\" she is sent to live with Dr. Yagami, and She then began living with the doctor's twin sons at the doctor's family home in Japan... \n\nPersia is not used to this new life. \n\nThis is the first volume of the hilarious wild girl slapstick manga!\n\n-Addendum on the Anime Adaptation:\n\nPersia's anime adaptation was the second in Pierrot's Magical Girl series after Creamy Mami, and the only one to be an adaptation. The title was altered from *\"I Love Persia!\"* to  *\"Persia, the Magic Fairy\"* (Maho no Yousei Persia, 魔法の妖精 ペルシャ)\n\nBarring Persia's design, which was adapted very closely, and elements of the content from the early chapters being adapted, there is little resemblance to the manga in terms of story, characterization, themes and so forth. \n\nPersia herself in the original manga attempts to adjust to the new environment she finds herself in, connecting with her new family, and moving on from her old habits, which serves as the purpose for both the gags and the dramatic elements in the narrative. It can be said the Persia manga served as a potential influence for works like Kiyohiko Azuma's [Yotsuba\u0026!](https://mangadex.org/title/58be6aa6-06cb-4ca5-bd20-f1392ce451fb/yotsuba).\n\nIn the anime adaptation, Persia is made to be a magical girl, and is granted her abilities before she arrives in Japan. Her outfit from the manga is her appearance after she transforms. She is tasked with gathering Love Energy to sustain the Lovely Dream realm. \n\nWhile dramatic moments surrounding Persia, and her family and friends are present in the anime adaptation as well, they are deliberations by Studio Pierrot and not based on any of the manga's content. \n\nIn fact, many of the anime adaptations dramatic moments might draw more parallels with moments seen in Pierrot's preceding Creamy Mami.\n\nWhile the manga has neither been scanlated nor officially translated, the anime adaptation can be viewed on the streaming service RetroCrush, seen [here](https://www.retrocrush.tv/series/027533s/persia%2C-the-magic-fairy)"},"links":{"al":"39883","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B074CM6BKN?binding=kindle_edition\u0026searchxofy=true\u0026ref_=dbs_s_aps_series_rwt_tkin\u0026qid=1668208601\u0026sr=8-1","bw":"series/22886/list","cdj":"https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-168439","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/280200/A000444250/","kt":"persia-ga-suki","mal":"9883","mu":"ofecjn8"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"b1e97889-25b4-4258-b28b-cd7f4d28ea9b","name":{"en":"Philosophical"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"da2d50ca-3018-4cc0-ac7a-6b7d472a29ea","name":{"en":"Delinquents"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

Jiro Manabe, who has a Japanese father and a Kurdish mother, visits Turkey for the first time in ten years, guided by a letter from his mother, who has been separated from him.\n\nThe letter, however, was sent by Qasim, a Kurdish armed guerrilla known as \"Demirel\" (Iron Arm), to lure Jiro to Turkey. Giraud is caught up in a confrontation between Kurdish guerrillas and Turkish security forces in Istanbul, and flees to Kurdistan, a remote region in eastern Turkey.\n\nIn a secret tribal cave, Jiro meets a mysterious boy who shares the same name, \"Jiro\". Kurdistan is still at the mercy of international politics and in the midst of the ravages of war. However, the Kurdish people have not yielded to the oppression of the Turkish security forces, the chemical weapons of Saddam Hussein, the terrorism of the Islamic State, or the airstrikes of the Assad regime. \n\nThis is a valuable work that allows the reader to touch the source of their indomitable spirit. The Kurdish people are such a hardy and courageous people, but they are also people of misfortune. They are a people whose survival is constantly threatened, but they will surely continue to survive. We can only watch them in silence from afar."},"links":{"al":"109610","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B08KWPLLBT?binding=kindle_edition\u0026searchxofy=true\u0026ref_=dbs_s_aps_series_rwt_tkin\u0026qid=1670964507\u0026sr=8-1","ap":"rebel-sword","bw":"series/200033/list","cdj":"https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-131481","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/534774/A002150945/","kt":"kurd-no-hoshi","mal":"108557","mu":"16893"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"5fff9cde-849c-4d78-aab0-0d52b2ee1d25","name":{"en":"Survival"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"ac72833b-c4e9-4878-b9db-6c8a4a99444a","name":{"en":"Military"}},{"id":"b1e97889-25b4-4258-b28b-cd7f4d28ea9b","name":{"en":"Philosophical"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"da2d50ca-3018-4cc0-ac7a-6b7d472a29ea","name":{"en":"Delinquents"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}
