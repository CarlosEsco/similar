She wants to design a house to live with her grandparents, but the woman's father is the design manager of the industry's top figure design office. When Ryosuke asks, \"Why is that so?\", it is said that his grandfather, who is also an architect, and his father had a violent confrontation over the new house, and that caused his grandfather to collapse. Therefore, in order to build the house that his grandfather wants, he wants to ask Ryosuke, who will be properly present at the demolition of the client's house, to design it. However, the other party is an architect who is the best in the industry. There is no guarantee of winning, so Ryosuke accepts the job (episode 1).\n▼Ryosuke is going to design the house of Mr. Ito, who is the coach of Dainichi Steel Basketball. However, although he had a meeting with his wife, Mr. Ito, who is the owner of the house, did not come to the meeting no matter how many times he called.

Includes a reflection of his time at the famous Tokiwa-so.\n\n- **Record of the Life of Gachaboy** (がちゃぼい一代記, Gachaboy Ichidaiki, ALT. ENG. - The God of Manga): A reflection on Tezuka's career up to that point. Tezuka  encounters the God of Manga right after the war, who nicknames Tezuka \"Gachaboy\". He is determined to see Tezuka become a great mangaka, no matter what - and restore manga's presence in Japan.\n- **Paper Fortress** (紙の砦, Kami no Toride):  Right at the end of the war, Tezuka is doing manga in private in high school. He meets a girl who fully understands his situation, and they get along well. In a society where manga, dancing, and even informal relationships are forbidden, how will Tezuka, crazy about manga, keep on?\n- **Hungry Blues** (すきっ腹のブルース, Sukippara no Blues): Directly following *Paper Fortress*, Tezuka is now a hungry, desperate student with little luck on his path in manga. Things change when he comes across a young lady who works for a newspaper, and he manages to land a serial for it. However,  in an era rife with turmoil and starvation, Tezuka's own stomach may prove to be a serious intrusion in not just his manga-making career, but his very life.\n- **Tokiwa-so Monogatari** (トキワ荘物語, ENG. - The Tale of Tokiwa-so): Part of a series recounting memories within the famous apartment complex, Tezuka showcases its history through commentary from the building itself!\n- **The Letter that Came** (という手紙がきた, Toiu Tegami ga Kita): Tezuka receives an ominous letter that may put him in hot water.\n- **Animal Tsurezuregusa** (動物つれづれ草, Doubutsu Tsurezuregusa): Two reflections on animals Tezuka had encountered in his early years - the first a horse, the second two tanuki.\n\nAn excerpt of *Dotsuitare* featuring Tezuka is also included at the end. This excerpt is a compilation of scenes/segments of Tezuka's scenes.\n\n---\n- **Animal Tsurezuregusa won the 21st Bungeishunju Manga Award in 1975, along with Tezuka's, very famous, Buddha**\n\n---\n**Volume 274 of the Osamu Tezuka Complete Works**","es":"(amazon.es):\n\nFinales de 1944, la Segunda Guerra Mundial aún no llegaba a su fin y las fuerzas norteamericanas empezaron una serie de intensos bombardeos contra las ciudades más grandes de Japón como Osaka, donde se llegaron a contar cerca de 10 000 civiles muertos. Tezuka tenía 16 años, él junto a sus compañeros fueron movilizados a Osaka para trabajar en un arsenal del ejército japonés.\n\nEn esos años, el dios del manga era constantemente reprendido por sus superiores, pues se la pasaba dibujando cómics en lugar de hacer su trabajo y un día su castigo consistió en subir a la torre de vigilancia para avisar si veía a los bombarderos B-29 de los Estados Unidos. No obstante, cuando empezó la alarma del ataque aéreo, no tuvo tiempo de bajar quedando expuesto en una de las edificaciones más altas de la fábrica. Entonces, una bomba cayó en el techo a dos metros de él y Tezuka cayó gritando de lo alto de la torre, pero milagrosamente logró sobrevivir. El futuro mangaka describe que el suelo y las casas de los alrededores estaban en llamas y del cielo caía una lluvia de hollín. En medio del caos, el chico decidió subir a la ribera del río Yodogawa y pudo apreciar los enormes cráteres donde habían caído las bombas y los cuerpos calcinados que se podían distinguir unos encima de los otros.\n\nEsta terrible experiencia junto con otras más son recogidas en la obra autobiográfica de Tezuka Osamu, Kami no Toride (Paper Fortess), publicada entre 1970 y 1977, una década clave para el discurso crítico a la guerra en el manga. Por esos años, según Jean Marie Bouissou, muchos autores de la generación del también animador japonés, crearon obras en las que mostraban su decepción ante los adultos qué habían decidido llevar a su país a un estado bélico y albergaban esperanzas en la juventud que podía cambiar el futuro. Tetsuwan Atomu del mismo Tezuka es un ejemplo de esta corriente y de la profunda importancia para el mangaka de los temas de la defensa de la paz y la condena a la guerra."},"links":{"al":"123453","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E6%89%8B%E5%A1%9A%E6%B2%BB%E8%99%AB-ebook/dp/B011BAO80U/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8\u0026qid=1652672121\u0026sr=8-3","ap":"kami-no-toride","bw":"de01db040f-50c3-4b5f-8f42-385caf7522f3","cdj":"https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-797943","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/100434/","kt":"kami-no-toride","mal":"92966","mu":"66702"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"0234a31e-a729-4e28-9d6a-3f87c4966b9e","name":{"en":"Oneshot"}},{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"0a39b5a1-b235-4886-a747-1d05d216532d","name":{"en":"Award Winning"}},{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"51d83883-4103-437c-b4b1-731cb73d786c","name":{"en":"Anthology"}},{"id":"5ca48985-9a9d-4bd8-be29-80dc0303db72","name":{"en":"Crime"}},{"id":"5fff9cde-849c-4d78-aab0-0d52b2ee1d25","name":{"en":"Survival"}},{"id":"92d6d951-ca5e-429c-ac78-451071cbf064","name":{"en":"Office Workers"}},{"id":"ac72833b-c4e9-4878-b9db-6c8a4a99444a","name":{"en":"Military"}},{"id":"b1e97889-25b4-4258-b28b-cd7f4d28ea9b","name":{"en":"Philosophical"}},{"id":"b29d6a3d-1569-4e7a-8caf-7557bc92cd5d","name":{"en":"Gore"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"c8cbe35b-1b2b-4a3f-9c37-db84c4514856","name":{"en":"Medical"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"cdad7e68-1419-41dd-bdce-27753074a640","name":{"en":"Horror"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}
