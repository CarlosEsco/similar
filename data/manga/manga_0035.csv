In ancient Korea (around 1200 BC), they used to be displayed at weddings, because they signified the ideas of \"faithfulness\" and \"longevity\", that are crucial for having a successful marriage. Camellias are often given to people that are most important in one's life - lovers, close friends and family.  \n  \n- White camellias communicate deep admiration, and can also symbolize perfection. Offered to the deceased, they can reflect peaceful mourning, and outside of Japan (where because of their connection to the concept of \"divinity\", and by indirect association, \"spirituality\" - as in \"something that is not of / doesn't belong to material world\" - gifting them to still breathing person can be considered an expression of ill will), they can also be given to the living as a genuine wish for good luck and fortune to reach them.  \n  \n- Pink camellias symbolize heartfelt longing, and are perfect for couples in long distance relationships. They convey sincere need for another's presence in one's life, and while it isn't advised, bouquet of those flowers can be used as somewhat \"safe\" (ambiguity) declaration of romantic intent between friends.  \n  \n- Red camellias express romantic love, desire, deep passion and symbolize excellence (or recognition and admiration of such quality in an individual).  \n  \nSome say that last two varieties combined together send stronger message than red flowers alone, in something akin to saying \"I hold you dearest and can't stand to be parted from you\". In context of the story, this could also be translated to \"I want to be like / Can't wait to become (as strong/skilled/great) as you\".  \n  \n-  \n  \nLilies - what they mean is strongly dependent not only on type (color) of the flower, but also the kind of relationship individual has with a person.  \n  \nThat said, white lilies in particular are almost uniformly connected to the concepts of \"virtue\" and \"purity\". When offered to the deceased, they're expression of a wish for departed soul to attain peace, and for it to regain the state of innocence (as in absolvement of sin, evil, worries etc.).||"},"originalLanguage":"ja","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"0234a31e-a729-4e28-9d6a-3f87c4966b9e","name":{"en":"Oneshot"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"b13b2a48-c720-44a9-9c77-39c9979373fb","name":{"en":"Doujinshi"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

The earth, which has lost its oceans, is devouring its prosperity by a people who have lost their spirit, who laugh at the men who fly off into uncharted space, and who do not deal properly with the dangers that lie ahead of them.\n\n When the flag of a skull flutters before the eyes of Tadashi Daiba, a boy who is disillusioned with Earth, his destiny is set in motion.... \n\nHarlock, a man of the universe who entrusts his destiny to the Arcadia, the greatest ship in the universe, and is unbound by anything. What does Tadashi Daiba think of his way of life...?\n\nWhat was serialized in Play Comic was Part 1 of the manga. Part 2 has not been serialized since due to issues with the Play Comic Editorial Dept. Leaving Harlock unfinished.\n\n[Official English](http://www.sevenseasentertainment.com/series/captain-harlock-the-classic-collection/)"},"links":{"al":"35115","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B074CMDX1K?binding=kindle_edition\u0026qid=1652718837\u0026sr=1-1\u0026ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tukn","ap":"captain-harlock","bw":"series/7537/list","cdj":"https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-2012038?s_ssid=e454b062827d074944","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/115358/","engtl":"http://www.sevenseasentertainment.com/series/captain-harlock-the-classic-collection/","kt":"10756","mal":"5115","mu":"6507","raw":"https://www.fukkan.com/fk/CartSearchDetail?i_no=68325158"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"5fff9cde-849c-4d78-aab0-0d52b2ee1d25","name":{"en":"Survival"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"ac72833b-c4e9-4878-b9db-6c8a4a99444a","name":{"en":"Military"}},{"id":"b1e97889-25b4-4258-b28b-cd7f4d28ea9b","name":{"en":"Philosophical"}},{"id":"b29d6a3d-1569-4e7a-8caf-7557bc92cd5d","name":{"en":"Gore"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"c8cbe35b-1b2b-4a3f-9c37-db84c4514856","name":{"en":"Medical"}},{"id":"da2d50ca-3018-4cc0-ac7a-6b7d472a29ea","name":{"en":"Delinquents"}},{"id":"df33b754-73a3-4c54-80e6-1a74a8058539","name":{"en":"Police"}},{"id":"e64f6742-c834-471d-8d72-dd51fc02b835","name":{"en":"Aliens"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

Frey, who kept staring me, tried to grab my suitcase. Taken aback, I held onto it tightly. In return, I heard a refreshing, clear laugh.\n\n\"Let me hold it for you.\"\n\n\"No, I\"m fine.\"\n\n\"Why? Oh, I get it. You're trying to escape. Am I getting in your way?\"\n\nThe hand holding the suitcase flinched. As he looked at me with an eerie smile, he looked exceedingly dangerous the more he stared. There was ice glistening behind his golden irises.\n\n\"You thought I wouldn't know,\" his large hand wrapped around mine and held the suitcase handle tightly, \"Just to avoid me and that bastard, you're trying to run away.\"\n\nHis harsh words didn’t match his aloof expression.\n\n\"It'll spell trouble, Yuni. If you disappear from my sight.\"\n\nThe gentle and feeble, sickly prisoner suddenly had became an obsessive yandere himself.\n\n---\nAfter being reborn as a wealthy duchess's daughter, Yurenia Rohelio thought she’d live her days rolling in cash. Unfortunately, she’s also fated to die at the hands of her obsessive, villainous brother Lysandro! To secure a happy ending, Yurenia has little choice but to train her psychotic twin while he's still young so he doesn't become a villain! But just when she thinks her plan will bear fruit, she begins to realize that there is actually more to this dark story than meets the eye...\n\n---\n[Original Novel](https://page.kakao.com/content/57280294)\n\n[Original Webtoon](https://page.kakao.com/content/59420891)\n\n**Official Translations:**\n* [English](https://tapas.io/series/taming-my-villainous-little-brother/info)\n* [Chinese (Simplified) / 汉语](https://www.kuaikanmanhua.com/web/topic/15794)\n* [French / Français](https://www.webtoons.com/fr/romance/lainee-du-fou-obsessionnel/list?title_no=4882)\n* [Japanese / 日本語](https://piccoma.com/web/product/109585)","fr":"Réincarnée dans un monde fantaisiste, Yuni a tout pour réussir dans cette nouvelle vie avec une famille aussi fortunée que puissante.

During the One Year War, the Earth Federation and the Principality of Zeon are fighting a brutal guerrilla war for control of the area and its resources.

Meanwhile the Earth Federal Army, which has been fighting the Zeon in the region, receive reinforcements in the form of Ensign Shiro Amada, newly named commander of the 08th MS Team. Aina and Shiro have met each other from a mutual rescue in space, but when Shiro discovers that Aina is in fact the pilot of the Zeon mobile armor he is arrested for treason. The Federation offers Shiro one chance at redemption: He must take the 08th MS Team deep into Zeon held territory to find Zeon’s hidden base.

The total number of tankobon published (26 volumes) exceeded 30 million, and the magazine in which it appeared, \"Weekly Shonen Champion\" became the first in the Japanese manga world to sell 2 million copies, which is a testament to the popularity of the manga.\n\nFor this e-book version, we have decided to use the Akita Shoten version (first edition) and \"Gaki Deka THE BEST\" (3 volumes, Shogakukan Creative) as the base.\n\n\"Gaki Deka THE BEST\" is basically scanned directly from the original manuscripts, proofread by the magazines in which they were published (Weekly Shonen Champion, Monthly Shonen Champion, etc.), and proofread by the mangaka, so the works included in \"Gaki Deka THE BEST\" have been fully utilized. The other works are not included in the book.\n\nOther works are based on the Akita Shoten version of the first edition.\n\nHowever, as was the custom in the publishing world at the time, the Akita Shoten edition was not released in the order in which it was first published, but in the order in which it appeared in the magazine. In addition, there were several manuscripts in the second and later editions of the Akita Shoten edition that had been revised, perhaps to respond to complaints.\n\n\nThis is \"Gaki Deka\" which is said to be one of the achievements of postwar democracy, Shunsuke Tsurumi is said to have said.\n\nAs long as \"Gaki Deka\" is read by everyone, as long as people have the self-image of \"Oh, there are people like this in Japan\" or \"Japan is like this\" I think we are still safe. I feel that we still have one step to go to the point where we can create a posture for war by saying, \"Fight for justice\" or \"crusade\".\n\n(Shunsuke Tsurumi, \"From the History of Manga\") I think that \"Gaki Deka\" is a work that should be read \"now,\" perhaps in this sense as well,\nRegardless of this, please read and laugh at this work first."},"links":{"al":"152669","amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/dp/B075TSNCK9?binding=kindle_edition\u0026ref=dbs_dp_rwt_sb_pc_tukn","ap":"gaki-deka","cdj":"https://www.cdjapan.co.jp/product/NEOBK-2353274","mal":"144826","mu":"jz4jpqf"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"5ca48985-9a9d-4bd8-be29-80dc0303db72","name":{"en":"Crime"}},{"id":"799c202e-7daa-44eb-9cf7-8a3c0441531e","name":{"en":"Martial Arts"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"da2d50ca-3018-4cc0-ac7a-6b7d472a29ea","name":{"en":"Delinquents"}},{"id":"df33b754-73a3-4c54-80e6-1a74a8058539","name":{"en":"Police"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

It is a strictly structured society with many rules, such as those governing when and where a predator is allowed to hunt their prey.  \n  \nOne lion, Leon, does not quite fit into the role nature has chosen for him. He doesn't grow his mane out, and, despite his physical strength, he shows no real interest in establishing territory and acquiring a harem of lionesses. But the most abnormal quirk of all is that Leon is a vegetarian lion!  \n  \nHis tiger companion (who has a bit of a crush on him), is firmly of the opinion that herbivores exist to be eaten, but she manages to mostly put up with his vegetarianism. One day, the two of them rescue a frightened gazelle, freshly arrived from the capital. The tiger is less than thrilled to have a pretty female food-animal hanging around with them, but the jackals who are tracking the gazelle seem to have some kind of business with Leon as well…  \n\n\n---\n\n**Links:**  \n- [Author's Twitter](https://twitter.com/glc09bk88pgot7u)"},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%81%BE%E3%81%A8%E3%82%81%E8%B2%B7%E3%81%84-%E3%83%AF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB%E3%83%89%E2%98%85%E3%82%AD%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0/dp/B07HCCKJTT/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8\u0026qid=1537206617\u0026sr=8-6\u0026keywords=%E3%83%AF%E3%82%A4%E3%83%AB%E3%83%89%E3%82%AD%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%83%80%E3%83%A0","ap":"the-wild-kingdom","bw":"series/175159","kt":"45490","mal":"99784","mu":"10874"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"36fd93ea-e8b8-445e-b836-358f02b3d33d","name":{"en":"Monsters"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"aafb99c1-7f60-43fa-b75f-fc9502ce29c7","name":{"en":"Harem"}},{"id":"dd1f77c5-dea9-4e2b-97ae-224af09caf99","name":{"en":"Monster Girls"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}}]}
