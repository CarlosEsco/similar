Our world changed forever that day as hordes of terrifying monsters, that we called Kaijin, began to cross over, and there was seemingly no end to their numbers. These vile beasts were not much bigger than men, but attacked with ferocity unlike anything on Earth. Despite the best efforts of the world’s armies, the Kaijin invasion spread across the planet like a disease.   \n  \nApproximately 400 years later, an estimated 5 billion Kaijin inhabit Earth, with only a fraction of the human race remaining. Over those 400 hundred years, it was survival of the fittest. Only the most exceptional from each generation would survive…and it is believed that for this reason, the newest generation have made an evolutionary jump. Incredible speed, incredible strength, telekinetic powers, lightning reflexes, and even super dense exoskeleton’s are just a few examples of how they evolved.  \n  \nA small team of these remarkable humans has formed in New L.A., and decide to head East in search of others like them. They need all the help they can get as they battle Kaijin and other obstacles, on their way to the rift site in Japan. Along the way, they also discover that it’s not as black and white as good versus evil. The 2 races have more in common than anyone could have imagined.

Like in the wonderful graphic novel from Frédéric Boilet, Yukiko's Spinach. For a French person, the two words \"spinach\" and \"navel\" in Japanese sound very much alike. You absolutely must read that book. It's very French New Wave, very simple and very beautiful. At the end, one can almost touch the texture, the skin and the kimono of the girl. Yukiko's Spinach, it's a painting and a short movie at the same time, hung on several plates of a comic book. »  \n  \nFrom Pascal Ory, Lire:  \n  \n« This is one of the most surprising books in the history of bande dessinée. Nevertheless, the methods he uses are among the most simple […] it's as if the author were telling us in real time about the little adventure he had with Yukiko Hashimoto. »  \n  \nFrom Éric Loret, Libération:  \n  \n« Yukiko in the hands of Boilet is the most beautiful girl in the world, beautiful like Anna Karina through Godard's eyes, beautiful like Maggie Cheung closely examined by Assayas […] Frédéric Boilet is an intimist, drawing the tenderness, the emotional tie, the loving relationship with a subjective camera, the fleeting moment where one finally grasps it. »"},"links":{"al":"44743","kt":"25075","mal":"14743","mu":"33706"},"originalLanguage":"fr","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

And the only reason she wanted the job at the chocolate factory is because of the fortunes included in their flagship chocolates and the woman who writes those fortunes, Junko Amano. But it turns out that Junko also has a side hustle, one which becomes her main hustle when the chocolate company lets her go—she trains people in extrasensory perception. Invitation only. Hatsugi desperately wants to be invited, especially since she learns from a couple people who have been that it’s only for those who have some talent with these things. And she is confident in her own spiritual abilities—the book starts with her insisting to a client that her fortune has to be correct. But the training company Junko’s set up looks less like spiritual training and an awful lot like a soapland or a sex club, complete with sexy naked times and bondage gear.

Angered at his disfigurement, James takes the name \"Alabaster\" and begins eliminating the hypocrites and the boastful.

Every 60 years, the \"ETM 12\" tournament takes place in Tokyo's Akihabara district, where aspiring girls from all over Japan gather for the chance to become the next zodiac sign. One of those girls is Nya-tan, a catgirl who was tricked by a sneaky rodent and was not able to become a Zodiac girl. There is only one condition to become an Eto-musume: you must defeat the other 12 signs. But with strength bestowed to them from the heavens above, no one has been able to defeat them for 2000 years. The story begins when Nya-tan meets Amato Takeru!"},"links":{"al":"86946","ap":"etotama","kt":"33331","mal":"82011","mu":"105042"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}}]}

However, his life took a turn when he unexpectedly reunited with his estranged father, the Prime Minister of the Emperor. His father offered him wealth and fame on the condition that Mokdan dressed as a woman and lived in the palace. The father's hidden motive was to establish a male Empress in the palace, thereby ending the royal family's lineage. Despite the difficult circumstances, Mokdan accepted the role of Empress, primarily out of concern for his mother. Over time, Mokdan's actions endeared him to the Emperor, who was moved by Mokdan's bravery when he foiled a plot to poison the Emperor. Gradually, the Emperor began to open his heart to Mokdan. Meanwhile, the Emperor's younger brother, who aimed to seize the throne, met an accidental death, leaving the Prime Minister with a new scheme. This plan involved giving Mokdan a medicine that could enable a man to conceive. To everyone's surprise, Mokdan miraculously gave birth to two children. Despite the newfound family, Mokdan grew weary of the distant Emperor, who had not been present for fifteen years, and the children felt isolated in the palace. One night, Mokdan decided to venture into the streets for a secret outing."},"originalLanguage":"ko","contentRating":"erotica","tags":[{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"5920b825-4181-4a17-beeb-9918b0ff7a30","name":{"en":"Boys' Love"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"e197df38-d0e7-43b5-9b09-2842d0c326dd","name":{"en":"Web Comic"}}]}

Set in a dreamy, idealistic Edo-period Japan intended to comfort children during the U.S. occupation, the story follows a young princess in a long-sleeved kimono. The princess, Anmitsu-hime, and other characters are named after sweets and desserts.\n\nThe series was incredibly popular, running in multiple magazines until 1962. It inspired an anime series, two movies, three TV dramas, a radio drama, and a video game, as well as a manga reboot in 1986. \n\n(Source: MangaUpdates)"},"links":{"kt":"anmitsu-hime-1949","mu":"l2s4hp7"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}}]}
