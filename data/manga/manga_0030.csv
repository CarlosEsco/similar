Arata knows that, yet can't help but reach out his hand… After three months away, Sojun, a famed guitarist, returns to Arata, editor of a well-regarded music magazine. Despite his talent, Sojun has cut himself off from the Japanese music scene. Unable to settle down, he bounces back and forth between countries, often leaving his longtime lover Arata behind. Arata knows that about Sojun, but can't help wishing he'd come back for good, to stay by his side, hold him and make love with him… The adult love between these two men flickers between Arata's admiration for Sojun's immense talent, his sense of inferiority, and the freedom and possessiveness that comes from affection."},"links":{"al":"100600","engtl":"https://comics.inkr.com/title/1306-whimsical-jaguar?utm_source=mgd","kt":"51041","mal":"109975","mu":"130665"},"originalLanguage":"ja","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"5920b825-4181-4a17-beeb-9918b0ff7a30","name":{"en":"Boys' Love"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

For this he has been given the curse of death.  \n  \nHe has begun a search through Japan to find the secret of his curse when he arrives at the encampment. Outside of the encampment he is attacked by the \"Monster Princess\", a girl raised in the woods by Moro no Kimi (a 300 year old female dog god) and who is driven by a fierce hatred for the humans who are destroying the forest. This girl, San, has repeatedly attacked the encampment, but after she meets Ashitaka, she becomes torn between her loyalty to the animal-gods and the world of the humans.  \nSurrounded by the warring characters of the humans on one side and the animal-gods on the other, each side believing in the righteouness of its cause, it is Ashitaka and San who must face each other personally and, by the end of the film, come to an understanding of each other's world and make the attempt to coexist without hatred and violence.  \n  \nNot far from the heart of the sacred forest where the great Deer God dwells, a new town called Irontown is founded. Conflict seems inevitable.  \n  \nA young girl raised by wolves, and a warrior bearing a curse inflicted by the hatred of a dying Boar God are trying to make things right. Will they succeed?"},"links":{"mu":"7623"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}}]}

Yaketpachi and Maria are joined at the soul, but ripped apart by an uncaring society. How much strain can Maria's plastic body take before it cracks beyond repair? Yaketpachi may want to move heaven and Earth to provide a life for Maria, but do teenagers truly know love?Osamu Tezuka brings the battle of the sexes to a paranormal comedy, where Yaketpachi and Maria explore their teenage years in High School, with all the trials and tribulations that come with it.

His grades are always high, he's generally liked by his classmates and everyone thinks he will get into a good college then onto a financially well-off career. But his life long dream that no one else, not even his family, knows about is to be a manga author, which realistically speaking has near impossible odds of working out. The reasons why he keeps it a secret is because he'd rather not try if he's more than likely to fail and also because he doesn’t want to end up like his classmate Anezaki Runa.  \n  \nRuna is also aspiring to be a manga author but is obsessed with it to the point where everyone keeps a distance from her because of her anti-social and weird habits. But one day, Runa finds out about Taiyo’s secret and forces him to pursue his dream. Taiyo learns that throughout his life, he has cared too much about public perception which will continue to limit his ability as a manga author unless he opens himself up even if it means rejection. With Runa’s help, he learns to believe in his dream and show his true potential.

They helped humanity create \"Ars Magus\", a fusion of magic and science, to defeat the Black Beast. This event would be later known as the First War of Magic.  \n  \nAfter the war, the Novus Orbis Librarium (also referred to as \"The Library\" or the \"NOL\") was created to govern the world with the use of Ars Magus. A great deal of dissent was caused by the Library, partly due to Ars Magus' use in nearly every facet of society, and the widening socioeconomic gap between those who could and couldn't use Ars Magus. This dissent would eventually form years later into the Second War of Magic or also known as the Ikaruga Civil War, when the city of Ikaruga openly rebelled against the NOL. Upon winning the war, the NOL imposed a harsher rule on the world, punishing any rebellion against the NOL with death.  \n  \nIn December A.D. 2199, several years after the Second War of Magic, a branch of the NOL was utterly destroyed by an SS-class rebel named \"Ragna\" also known as the \"Grim Reaper\", in an attempt to destroy the Librarium. The NOL, hoping to stop him, immediately announced the largest bounty ever, available to anyone who could capture him. Interestingly, Ragna possesses a powerful form of Ars Magus known as the \"Azure Grimoire.\" This led the NOL, as well as the other fighters, to hunt Ragna not just for his bounty, but also his Azure Grimoire.  \n  \nBlazBlue - Chimelical Complex, is the manga adaptation of BlazBlue - Calamity Trigger, the hit fighting game developed by Arc System Work."},"links":{"al":"57085","ap":"blazblue-chimelical-complex","kt":"20599","mal":"27085","mu":"55700"},"originalLanguage":"ja","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}}]}

Being a single mother to a little boy, she intends to close it down and move on with life. However, in the solitary store that sits next to the last bus stop at the tip of a peninsula lie some long-buried memories that slowly reemerge as Mitsuko arrives at what used to be her home—memories of a lonesome childhood and of people who came to the peninsula to end their lives.  \n  \nThe Labyrinth Cat (chapter 2):  \nResidents who have just moved in are always lost in this complex apartment. However, there is one little feline that will help them get back to their apartment house.","pl":"Misaki De Basu Wo Orita Hito: Mitsuko Kunizaki odziedziczyła po babci mały sklep, znajdujący się na szczycie klifu, przy ostatnim przystanku autobusowym.
