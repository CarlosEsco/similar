A messenger of\njustice who soars through the skies and soars into space! His name is National Kid !\n\nSynopsis\nSuddenly, a mysterious disk attacked the National Diet Building. The mysterious disk explains that \"Three Z Abbeyka\" from Venus is admonishing the Earth, which has repeatedly conducted atomic and hydrogen bomb tests. A destroyed city, people who develop space sickness one after another. Furthermore, even Dr. Mizuno, who is trying to create a vaccine for the space disease, is kidnapped by \"Three Z Abika\"...\nJust when you think you're in a desperate situation, National Kid appears to confront the saucer!\n\nSpecial commentary by Mr. Yoshikazu Takeuchi\nIn order to protect the justice and peace of the earth, our national kid has fought fierce battles over land, sea and air with monsters and such as the Venusian Inca and the undersea demon Nercon. As soon as it was televised in 1960, it became extremely popular among children. The secret to its popularity is, above all, the coolness of Kid, who can realistically fly around the sky. What supported such a surprising flight scene was special effects technology using a one-shot camera developed by Konishi Roku (currently Konica Minolta), which was groundbreaking at the time. By directly synthesizing the actor who plays Kid and the live-action aerial shot scene, we have created a screen that has never been seen before in the history of television.\nThis popular hero was, of course, made into a manga by master Daiji Ichimine, contributing to the increased circulation of the magazine Bokura. The unique touch of Daiji Ichimine, who took the world by storm with his dynamic style of painting, is full of power and charm that makes your hands sweat even when you read it again now. It is an entertainment work recommended not only for nostalgic manga fans and Ichimine fans, but also for special effects fans and transforming hero fans."},"links":{"mu":"7kjgvf7"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"36fd93ea-e8b8-445e-b836-358f02b3d33d","name":{"en":"Monsters"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}}]}

The Perverted Virgin Public Morals Committee Member’s Secret Naughty Request\n\nAsai Saki is a wolf in sheep’s clothing. Or more precisely, she’s a slut in straight-laced clothing.\n\nWhen our protagonist gets called out to meet her after school, he expected the strict public morals officer of the class to chastise him for something. What he didn’t expect is to find that she came to school wearing sexy underwear, planning to have him take her virginity and fuck her senseless...\n\n2. The Perverted Virgin Public Morals Committee Member’s Secret Naughty Request 2\n\nIn the first chapter, we found out that Saki is a massive pervert when she became our protagonist’s friend with benefits. The surprises never end with her though; in chapter two, she invites him to a love hotel and comes with a bag full of equipment to enhance the experience.\n\nFull body lube play, bathtub sex, roleplaying, cosplay sex... It’s never boring when Saki’s around!\n\n3. The Perverted (Anal) Virgin Public Morals Committee Member’s Secret Naughty Request 3\n\nIf Saki is supposed to be on her school’s public morals committee and uphold “public morals”, she’s doing an exceedingly bad job of it. In fact, she’s a walking thread to public morals, the horny pervert she is.\n\nDuring the previous cosplay session, she mentioned she’d like to try anal sex. In this chapter she implements her plan, first training herself with fingers, then various toys and even having her boyfriend help her out. For the final act, she invites her boyfriend to her house and wears a bunny girls suit to greet him.\n\nThey don’t even make it to her room before some hard anal action starts happening.\n\n4. The Perverted Virgin Public Morals Committee Member’s Secret Naughty Request 4\n\nThis doujin pick up right where the previous chapter left off: Saki was having some wild sex with her boyfriend when her (equally well endowed) little sister Shiki walks in on them. Luckily for her, the couple don’t notice her, so she manages to hide and watch them go at it.\n\nBut since Shiki is as pervy as her sister, she starts touching herself while peeping. Of course she eventually gets discovered and of course she ends up in a threesome. What did you expect?\n\n5. The Perverted Virgin Public Morals Committee Member’s Secret Naughty Request 5\n\n6.

The King of Fighters, who had obtained the highest attribute type with his \"physical strength\" and not his attributes or other abilities, saw Shin Yu-Sung in a different light. Ninth Pulse “Your innate ninth pulse is overflowing in your body with mana! Extreme intellect! And an ethereal appearance! But you’ll die before becoming an adult…” And Yang Body Type “The energy of the Yang Body that can cure the Ninth Pulse is overflowing in your body!” In the King of Fighter’s eyes, Shin Yu-Sung only had an F-Class attribute, but is a monster born with the body and constitution that appeared once every millennium. Thus, having been abandoned by his family because of his talent, Shin Yu-Sung ironically became the King of Fighter’s pupil because of it. Twelve years passed and Shin Yu-Sung, who finished all the preparations, finally left the mountains where he had trained. Shin Yu-Sung’s strength isn’t an attribute that Hunters value but is simply his “physical strength.” A hunter, that's unlike any seen before, was born.","ko":"최악이라 불리는 F급 특성. 5살의 신유성은 헌터 명가인 신오가문에서 버림받는다.\n그리고 같은 해, 고아원에서 헌터들의 정점인 권왕을 만나 거두어 진다.\n권왕은 특성이나 능력 아닌 ‘체술’로 정점에 오른 헌터.\n그는 신유성의 특성이 아닌 체질에 주목한다.\n\n구음절맥(九陰絶脈).\n“네가 타고난 구음절맥은 몸에 마나가 넘쳐흐르고! 머리가 비상해지며! 천상의 외모를 가진다! 하지만 성인이 되기 전에 죽고 말지…….”\n\n그리고 극양지체(極陽肢體).\n“네 몸은 구음절맥을 치료할 양기가 넘쳐흐른다!”\n\n권왕의 눈에 신유성은 비록 F급 특성이지만 천년에 한번 태어날 체질과 신체를 모두 가진 괴물이었다.\n그렇게 재능 때문에 가문에게 버림받은 신유성은 아이러니하게도 다시 재능 때문에 권왕의 제자로 거두어진다.\n\n12년이란 시간이 흐르고 모든 준비를 마친 신유성이 하산했다.\n신유성의 강함은 헌터들이 중요시 여기는 특성이 아닌, 순수한 체술.\n지금껏 없던 헌터의 탄생이었다."},"links":{"mu":"193929","raw":"https://page.kakao.com/home?seriesId=55725050"},"originalLanguage":"ko","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"0234a31e-a729-4e28-9d6a-3f87c4966b9e","name":{"en":"Oneshot"}},{"id":"36fd93ea-e8b8-445e-b836-358f02b3d33d","name":{"en":"Monsters"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"799c202e-7daa-44eb-9cf7-8a3c0441531e","name":{"en":"Martial Arts"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"a1f53773-c69a-4ce5-8cab-fffcd90b1565","name":{"en":"Magic"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"f4122d1c-3b44-44d0-9936-ff7502c39ad3","name":{"en":"Adaptation"}},{"id":"f5ba408b-0e7a-484d-8d49-4e9125ac96de","name":{"en":"Full Color"}}]}

Do they really have a certain durability? A writer thinks so, and she bases her novel on the idea.  \n  \nA Strange Gene is about Ayano Yoshimusa; a superb worker, efficient, accurate, and cold. Saegusa, her colleague, is her opposite: messy, chaotic and warm. He admires his boss, whenever he talks to her he realises what a perfect creature she is.
