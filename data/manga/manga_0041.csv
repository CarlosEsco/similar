This technology is used by the Sibyl system to separate those who are judged to have the potential to commit crimes from the rest of society, and sometimes to execute them on the spot using a 'Dominator' gun. The detectives that hunt down criminals and potential criminals work in pairs of \"Inspectors,\" who are respected citizens, and \"Enforcers,\" who are expected to have insight into the minds of criminals. The story features Inspector Tsunemori Akane, who is now no longer a rookie detective, and introduces a new young Inspector named Shimotsuki Mika, who will join the fight against criminals and those judged to be potential criminals."},"links":{"al":"102887","ap":"psycho-pass-2","bw":"series/46549","kt":"26870","mal":"81151","mu":"115613"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"cdad7e68-1419-41dd-bdce-27753074a640","name":{"en":"Horror"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}
