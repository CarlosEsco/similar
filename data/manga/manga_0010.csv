Can Renea pull off having two husbands without getting caught?","pl":"\"Proszę, niech mój mąż mnie kocha, nawet w swojej śmierci\".\n\nNa posągu, który spełnia życzenia, Renier życzyła sobie miłości swojego zdradzającego męża, ale potem zginęła z jego rąk.\nKiedy ponownie otworzyła oczy, Renier powróciła do momentu, w którym wypowiedziała życzenie.\nZe wszystkich chwil, to musiał być dokładnie ten moment, w którym wypowiedziała słowo \"mąż\".\n\nŻyczenia nie mogły być zmienione, utracone lub zatrzymane w środku. W końcu Renier wypowiedziała życzenie, gdy tylko wyszło z jej ust...\n\n\"Proszę, niech mój mąż...
