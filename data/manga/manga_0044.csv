Kotobuki has a serious crush on Hodaka-san, and spends a lot of her time at the cafe across the street just watching him work through the store window.\n\nThings change one day when Hodaka and 2 of his friends actually got to the cafe too, and ask to sit at Kotobuki’s table because the other seats are all taken. Kotobuki lies to the guys about her age, claiming to be 20 years old and in college. Hodaka-san is 26 years old, and Kotobuki is worried that because she is only 14, he will not like her. Kotobuki is thrilled when Hodaka’s friends start teasing her and ask her which of them she would like as a boyfriend, she immediately chooses Hodaka-san.

Taro learns of this by chance and is targeted by the Dolmanians. After repeatedly running and being chased, Taro is caught and taken to Dolmania. Taro is sentenced to death, but is saved by the country's princess.\n\n That night, the poor neighboring kingdom of Crocodia kidnaps the princess to blackmail Dolmania. Taro rescues the princess and is trusted by the king, who appoints him a colonel in the army. Soon after, a certain count claims retaliation against Crocodia, but is opposed by Taro and his friends. This count is the mastermind behind the gold coin collection.\n\n The count rebels, imprisons the king and princess, and tries to become king himself. The Count wages war against the crocodile, but loses, thanks in part to Taro's efforts. The Count flees the country, forms a gang, and steals Dormania's crown. Taro recovers the crown and traps and captures the Count. Having brought peace, Taro returns to Japan with a jewel from the princess.\n\n**Overview** - \n\n Speed Taro began serialization in Yomiuri Sunday Manga, a supplement to the Sunday edition of the Yomiuri Shimbun, in December 1930, moved to Yomiuri Shonen Shimbun in the middle of the series, and ended in February 1934. Total length of 113 pages; a boxed, multicolored, gorgeous single-volume edition was published by Daiichi Shobo in 1935.\n\n The story depicts the exploits of a boy named \"Taro,\" who, with a bear and a monkey as companions, engages in various battles with rogues in various settings, such as in the mountains and on a boat. The manga is replete with comedic action and fantastical scientific props throughout, such as Taro and his friends sliding upside down with ski boards on their heads and flying vertical takeoff and landing planes from a secret base in pursuit of their enemies.\n\n The manga used techniques previously unseen in Japanese manga, such as close-ups, long shots, and other cinematic compositions, framing, and perspective changes. For example, in the scene where the thugs try to cut the rope suspending Taro in a high place, after depicting the suspended Taro and the ground below him from a bird's eye view, a long shot from below depicts Taro in a small size to heighten the sense of fear. Then, a close-up depicts the bad guy's knife being applied to the pinned rope, creating a sense of urgency.\n\n The success of this work led to the proliferation of newspaper serialization of children's manga and illustrated stories for children, and newspapers began to play a major role in the distribution of manga and illustrated stories in the early Showa period.\n\n**Addendum** -\n\n As mentioned in the *Overview* Speed Taro is an early work considered to be or possess elements of a Long-Form Story Manga (a term still used by Mangaka to this day). \n\nThis term is used to describe works like Tezuka's **[New Treasure Island](https://mangadex.org/title/63487511-434d-4a98-a1da-13bf80e9fcb8/new-treasure-island-1947)**, works in where a mix of varying compositions and panel layouts (in contrast to 4Koma) would communicate, well, a long form story (Though New Treasure Island is a work that makes  use of 2/3 panels per page).\n\nMany Manga Scholars in Japan have discrepancy when Osamu Tezuka is the only subject of discussion in refence to Early Post-War Manga, or Early Manga period.

(further details in the rest of the desc.)\n\nSerialized in Weekly Shonen Champion.\n\nDescriptions for each chapter:\n\n- Chapter 1 - **Sham Appears**\nAn odd cat who can speak human language comes running into\nthe apartment of a ronin student boy. The cat also turns into a bishojo!\n\n- Chapter 2 - **Cutting a Tail, and a Great Transformation...!?**\nBan (The last name of this ronin student) goes to his part-time job, but Sham, wanting attention, follows him around after.\n\n- Chapter 3 - **Dig Up Shadows, Nyan Nyan!!**\nAll living things have a great weakness. You'll know right away when you dig up their shadow...\nSham displays her mysterious ESP, and an enemy bearing an existential crisis draws near.\n\n- Chapter 4 - **When You Want to be Popular, This Scent...**\nBan falls in love with Ranko, the idol of Ajima Prep. He tearfully wishes,\n\"I want to be popular for once!!\" Sham easily succeeds in granting this.\n\n- Chapter 5 - **A Reassuring Ally Appears!!**\nTomorrow is the entrance exams at last, yet Ban isn't doing well and becomes frantic.\nHe is able to fall asleep from Sham's ESP, but Sham's fleas start to rampage...\n\nSham Cat was collected into Azuma's **Absurdity Diary** (不条理日記, Fujouri Nikki), a compilation of short SF one-shots and serials which were parodies of popular SF works and it was released the same year. Absurdity Diary won the 10th Seiun Award for Best Comic also within the same year.\n\nAzuma mentions that Sham Cat is intended to be a parody of Shambleau by female American SF author C. L. Moore (part of the Northwest Smith series of short stories). But in addition to this, one could also observe two key influences in Sham Cat.\n\nSham Cat, both the character and the manga, is Azuma's composite of two series, [Urusei Yatsura](https://mangadex.org/title/6b9206b3-5c0f-4cf8-a0cc-d2c9e1aa4df9/urusei-yatsura), and its female lead, Lum, and [The Star of Cottonland](https://mangadex.org/title/6bc9f38a-9a36-4a3f-9a70-4d465e9d597f/the-star-of-cottonland) with its lead, Chibi-Neko, both of which were being serialized around this time, and Azuma himself professed to very fond of Urusei Yatsura from its very first chapter (source: QuickJapan, issue 71). \n\nThe compositions, tone, flow, plots, and characterization of Sham Cat parallels Lum and the early chapters of Urusei Yatsura, with additional elements being from Chibi-Neko.\n\nHideo Azuma's lasting influence with Sham Cat can still be seen to this day. What frequently, and erroneously, is referred to as the 'Anime Cat Girl' are all modern day Sham Cats. One could humorously say that we have many different breeds of Sham Cats today."},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"2d1f5d56-a1e5-4d0d-a961-2193588b08ec","name":{"en":"Loli"}},{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"a1f53773-c69a-4ce5-8cab-fffcd90b1565","name":{"en":"Magic"}},{"id":"aafb99c1-7f60-43fa-b75f-fc9502ce29c7","name":{"en":"Harem"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"dd1f77c5-dea9-4e2b-97ae-224af09caf99","name":{"en":"Monster Girls"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}}]}
