Essential components of all matter on planet Auldrant.  \n  \nAges ago, a new type of fonon was discovered—the Seventh Fonon. Its discovery threw humanity into chaos, for if one could use the Seventh Fonon, one could learn the future. Wars over the Seventh Fonon raged across the lands, ending only when the miasma—a poison from within the planet—covered the entire world. This is when Yulia appeared.  \n  \nA fonist skilled in prophecy, Yulia saw thousands of years into the future and foresaw a way to seal away the miasma. With the guidance of her prophecies, humanity sealed the miasma deep within the planet.  \n  \nOver two thousand years passed.  \n  \nThe world is ruled by Yulia's prophecy, known as the Score. People believe in the coming “unprecedented prosperity” promised in the Score, never straying from the path set forth in the Score which will lead them to that prosperity. They look to the Score as revealed by the Order of Lorelei, the religion Yulia founded, and hold that the greatest virtue is to follow the Score faithfully.  \n  \nYulia's Score tells of a young man who is necessary in order to bring “unprecedented prosperity.” His name is Luke fon Fabre. An heir to the throne of the Kingdom of Kimlasca-Lanvaldear, he was kidnapped as a child by the kingdom's enemy, the Malkuth Empire. Since his return he has been confined to his family's manor for his own safety. He has no idea of the evil that now draws close.  \n  \nBased on the role-playing game of the same name by Namco Tales Studio."},"links":{"al":"31756","ap":"tales-of-the-abyss","kt":"3724","mal":"1756","mu":"4689"},"originalLanguage":"ja","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}}]}

Kou is a young attendant at a bathhouse. Naoto meets Kou after a crappy day in which he misses his school entrance ceremony, loses his job, and then it turns out his hot water at home is shut off for a while. So he has to go to the bathhouse Kou works at. Initially Kou looks young, gentle and beautiful, but soon enough Naoto learns Kou's true nature – he's brash and quick to anger, much older than his appearance hints at and not nearly so naive (at least, not in the way he appears). But his body is nonetheless small and so Naoto doesn't want Kou to take up all the bathhouse jobs on his own. Thus, Naoto starts working for the bathhouse when he can.

Tachibana is very protective of Asagi and grows even more so when Asagi faints every time he uses the Heavenly Sword. How can Tachibana protect the one he loves?  \n  \n2. The Dangerous New Moon  \nHaruaki visits the priest, Ei, everyday on his lunch break. Haruaki confides any troubles he's been having to Ei, and Ei very much enjoys the company.

So when he spies a Help Wanted sign outside an office and a hot girl inside, he applies for the job, no questions asked. After a few bumps at the beginning, things start going Taiga’s way, prompting him to steel his courage and ask out Yuiko, that hot girl he spied through the window, on a date. And when she later asks him if it’s okay that she’s a fujoshi (a very, shall we say, distinct kind of comics/animation geek), he tells her it’s fine out of sheer excitement. But poor Taiga has no idea how much trouble he’s just gotten himself into!  \n  \nItalian: Uno studente universitario si innamora di una ragazza più grande di lui che fa il suo stesso lavoro part time. Riesce a mettersi con lei per poi scoprire che è un'otaku, in particolare è una gran appassionata di yaoi. Per Taiga inizia così una relazione che metterà a dura prova la sua pazienza."},"links":{"al":"40804","ap":"my-girlfriends-a-geek","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/24731/","engtl":"https://yenpress.com/my-girlfriends-a-geek-manga/","kt":"20595","mal":"10804","mu":"17746","nu":"fujoshi-kanojo"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

Gift's power can only be evoked by each person once in a lifetime, and is able to grant a single miracle. To be successful, a Gift must reflect the shared feelings of both the giver and the receiver. If the feelings are not mutual, the Gift is distorted and has the ability to wreak havoc on the surrounding area. When this happens, a black streak appears in the rainbow above town until Gift is used correctly. The story begins as Haruhiko's younger sister, Riko Fukimine, returns home after several years away. Beginning with her appearance, Haruhiko's life starts to change very quickly and feelings of the past begin to surface once more."},"links":{"al":"40759","ap":"gift-under-the-rainbow","kt":"20549","mal":"10759","mu":"11259"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"aafb99c1-7f60-43fa-b75f-fc9502ce29c7","name":{"en":"Harem"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}}]}

When you peek into the basket, you see a cute baby wrapped in baby clothes smiling innocently. You are still clueless as your face relaxes in sympathy. You are still unaware of the wretched demon that resides in her soft, little body! It was at a general hospital that the body of Mr. J. Smith's baby was found a month after his death. Something was born out of the corpse a month after its death. Soon after, an unprecedented incident occurs in the neonatal room. When the nurses took their eyes off the baby, all the babies in the neonatal room disappeared. Only one baby remained, Mr. Smith's baby. The baby, named Priscilla, returns home with her parents, but all sorts of ominous things begin to happen to the Smith family. Why in the world-?　\n\nThe title story, \"Black Angel Sincera,\" is the first in a polished series after \"Mr. J. Smith's Baby.\"  While all the babies in the newborn room have died, only one baby, Sincera, is released from the hospital alive and well. With her cute sleeping face, her parents believe that she is an angel who brings happiness to everyone. However, the family was facing a series of ominous incidents and accidents. Then, the father, Paul, discovers the true nature of his beloved daughter, Sincera. What will the wheels of fate that have begun to turn so noisily lead the family to the end?
