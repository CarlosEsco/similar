(Make Love Shiyo!!). (v01 ch1 to 6) Mari Nishimiya is a high school junior who's tired of playing it safe. Less concerned with her summer session and more with achieving the love of a lifetime, she ventures to a foreigners' pub with her childhood friend, Yuuta. There, she meets Leon Gardner, an American dancer with a talented tongue (…meaning, he's bilingual)! While Yuuta disapproves, having an unrequited love for Mari himself, he and other enemies of this international relationship may be powerless to stop it when Leon joins Mari's class as… (!!!)  \n  \nLet's Make Love!! - Farside Story (Make Love Shiyo!! Chou - Bangaihen). (v01 omake). Shinjo Mayu parodies her own work by inserting new dialogue into some of her pages from v01. It's the tale of the Gardner family, where Leon is Papa, Chris is Mama, and Mari is their daughter! Additional curiosities included.   \n  \nLet's Make More Love!! (Motto Make Love Shiyo!!). (v02 ch7). Mari wants to have an adult Christmas with Leon. Why is Leon so set against it?   \n  \nLet's Always Make Love!! (Zutto Make Love Shiyo!!). (v02 ch8). Attending the international wedding of Leon's friend, Randy, has Mari thinking in a new way about her future. But when Mari begins to feel strangely sick and misses her period, the circumstance forces her to make an early decision! But Leon suddenly has to leave for America!? Why?? Mari isn't going to like the reason Randy gives her…   \n  \n2) I Don't Need Any Scenario! (Shinario Nante Iranai!). (v02 ch9). This ground-breaking short story was Shinjo Mayu's first work to contain a provocative sex scene and to mark her as a borderline pornographer! Read the freetalk to learn more! Yuuya is the manager of the drama club, and he's very strict and exacting about how the student thespians handle their roles. Chiharu is supposed to be playing a woman in love, but there's no emotion in her performance! So it's handsome Yuuya's job to teach her how to long for a man… Was this scenario in the script!?   \n  \n3) I Want to Be Painted with Your Color (Anata no Iro ni Somaritai). (v02 ch10). This short story is Shinjo Mayu's debut work. Kazumi Inoue wants to be transformed by the magic of a white wedding dress, and then painted in a man's color. The biggest delinquent in school, Kazuya Sakurai, wasn't who she had in mind, though! He's intent on painting her a different color – why? Kazumi will have her wish - a transformation through the magic of a wedding dress - but not in a way that anyone expects!   \n  \n(v02 omake). A whopping nine pages covering a variety of topics. Get a sneak peek into Shinjo Mayu's office, find out her favorite stories and characters, see Leon with a top knot, see Leon touch Yuuta in inappropriate ways, and at long last the burning question is answered: How are chihuahuas significant to this serialization!?"},"links":{"al":"35773","ap":"make-love-shiyo","kt":"12678","mal":"5773","mu":"1889"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}}]}

Composed of vignettes from the daily lives of a group of people inhabiting an ordinary neighborhood somewhere in Tokyo, the series is actually a comment about modern life itself and how we can survive in it despite all its rigors.  \n  \nAmusing, melancholic, funny, strange, thought-provoking, Asano effortlessly shifts from one mood to another, creating stories and characters that are profoundly human and thus always involving. It's a shame that not everyone will find the subjects the author describes equally appealing since some of them are distinctly Japanese. But overall, it's a great collection that any discerning manga reader should check out.\n\n[Official English](https://www.viz.com/read/manga/what-a-wonderful-world/all)"},"links":{"al":"33614","ap":"what-a-wonderful-world","engtl":"https://www.viz.com/read/manga/what-a-wonderful-world/all","kt":"8033","mal":"3614","mu":"5836"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"07251805-a27e-4d59-b488-f0bfbec15168","name":{"en":"Thriller"}},{"id":"36fd93ea-e8b8-445e-b836-358f02b3d33d","name":{"en":"Monsters"}},{"id":"39730448-9a5f-48a2-85b0-a70db87b1233","name":{"en":"Demons"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"5ca48985-9a9d-4bd8-be29-80dc0303db72","name":{"en":"Crime"}},{"id":"85daba54-a71c-4554-8a28-9901a8b0afad","name":{"en":"Mafia"}},{"id":"92d6d951-ca5e-429c-ac78-451071cbf064","name":{"en":"Office Workers"}},{"id":"b1e97889-25b4-4258-b28b-cd7f4d28ea9b","name":{"en":"Philosophical"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"cdad7e68-1419-41dd-bdce-27753074a640","name":{"en":"Horror"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"da2d50ca-3018-4cc0-ac7a-6b7d472a29ea","name":{"en":"Delinquents"}},{"id":"df33b754-73a3-4c54-80e6-1a74a8058539","name":{"en":"Police"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}},{"id":"eabc5b4c-6aff-42f3-b657-3e90cbd00b75","name":{"en":"Supernatural"}},{"id":"ee968100-4191-4968-93d3-f82d72be7e46","name":{"en":"Mystery"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}

The story can be very light hearted, and then very depressing sometimes. The tone is, IMHO, overall melancholic. Comparing with some other bland shounen stuffs that are out there, 19 scores far above the field.  \n  \nKazushi Kubota is an eighteen-year-old guy that has never had a girlfriend.

At this moment in time, the city is a mixture of extremes... past and present, rich and poor, good and bad. This is a city where we see both horsecarts and motorcars, swords and pistols, lords and businessmen.\nA wealthy woman from an upper-class family finds herself attracted to a handsome young man, Taka. He and his younger brother seem to be allied, perhaps not entirely willingly, with some of the city's criminal underground (Yakuza). The lady's lovely young maidservant, Sara, meets him too, and a conflict ensues which can only lead to tragedy, passion, and dishonor. But, as events move on, and the days pass, the viewer sees a terrible date coming closer... that unforgettable day of September 1, 1923, at 11:58, when the Great Kanto Earthquake and tidal wave struck Tokyo, causing the death of almost 100,000 people, one of the greatest disasters in human history."},"links":{"mu":"t1om9dp"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"josei","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"33771934-028e-4cb3-8744-691e866a923e","name":{"en":"Historical"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"85daba54-a71c-4554-8a28-9901a8b0afad","name":{"en":"Mafia"}},{"id":"97893a4c-12af-4dac-b6be-0dffb353568e","name":{"en":"Sexual Violence"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"f8f62932-27da-4fe4-8ee1-6779a8c5edba","name":{"en":"Tragedy"}}]}
