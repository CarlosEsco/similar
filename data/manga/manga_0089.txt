During a battle against an onslaught of extraterrestrial beasts, his father, known as the “Great Sword Saint,” heroically sacrificed himself.\nIn a cruel twist of fate, Sword Number One was ambushed and killed, carrying with him boundless resentment and unanswered questions. However, the wheel of destiny had other plans for him. He awoke in the body of an Earth child with the same name. Not only was this new life a lowly prisoner, but he also possessed the lowest-grade lineage of a worthless plant-based bloodline."},"links":{"mu":"22b2zcf","raw":"https://ac.qq.com/Comic/ComicInfo/id/654481"},"originalLanguage":"zh","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3e2b8dae-350e-4ab8-a8ce-016e844b9f0d","name":{"en":"Long Strip"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}},{"id":"cdc58593-87dd-415e-bbc0-2ec27bf404cc","name":{"en":"Fantasy"}},{"id":"e197df38-d0e7-43b5-9b09-2842d0c326dd","name":{"en":"Web Comic"}},{"id":"f5ba408b-0e7a-484d-8d49-4e9125ac96de","name":{"en":"Full Color"}}]}

The child then comes to the Toudou house and starts working as a maid."},"links":{"al":"171702","mal":"164921","mu":"9zls7wj"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"seinen","contentRating":"suggestive","tags":[{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"5920b825-4181-4a17-beeb-9918b0ff7a30","name":{"en":"Boys' Love"}},{"id":"9ab53f92-3eed-4e9b-903a-917c86035ee3","name":{"en":"Crossdressing"}},{"id":"ddefd648-5140-4e5f-ba18-4eca4071d19b","name":{"en":"Shota"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}
