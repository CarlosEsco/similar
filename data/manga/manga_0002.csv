In the palm of your hand...\"\n\"Small Giant Microman\" \u0026 \"Microman Red Powers\" celebrating their 25th anniversary!\nReissued with a large volume of about 780 pages in total, including about 200 pages that have not been recorded.\n\nIn 1974, Takara (currently Takara Tomy) sent out a masterpiece SF toy series \"Microman\" . Even after the first development in 1980, it is a popular series that has been revived many times in response to its popularity.\nIn many of the product series that have been released intermittently like this, media development centered on comicalization has also been carried out. Among them, \"Small Giant Microman\", which is based on the toy series \"Microman Magne Powers\" developed in 1998, is the only animation work and boasts high name recognition. And based on the anime of the same name, the manga written by Hisashi Matsumoto is this work \"Small Giant Microman\".\n\nAlthough positioned as a \"comicalized\", this work, which began serialization in Kodansha's \"Comic Bonbon\" in 1997 in advance of the anime, has attracted a wide range of readers due to its attractive character modeling, unique story development, and sophisticated drawings. It gained popularity and continues to be highly rated to this day.\nHowever, while \"Small Giant Microman\", which was serialized in \"Comic Bonbon\" from the October 1998 issue to the December 1999 issue, was made into a book in all three volumes, the direct sequel \"Microman\" was serialized subsequently. Red Powers” ​​(serialized in the February 2000 issue to the July 2000 issue of Comic Bonbon) was not published in book form, and the only way to get a sense of the story was by looking at the actual magazine.\n\nTherefore, this time, with the cooperation of Professor Hisashi Matsumoto and related companies, we will publish \"Small Giant Microman\" and \"Microman Red Powers\" in a newly edited two-volume book.\nFor this publication, we have collected and scanned all the existing books and published magazines. The scanned images have been digitally restored, and the image quality has been updated to withstand republication.\n\nA5 version, this book will be sent in a large volume of about 780 pages in total for the first and second volumes. Please take it in your hand and check the ending of the story.\n\n★ Features of this book\n1. The first book that covers the manga works \"Small Giant Microman\" and \"Microman Red Powers\".\n2. A large volume of about 780 pages in total for the first and second volumes.\n3. The image quality has been greatly updated from the existing book by digital restoration."},"links":{"mu":"dq61suu"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"50880a9d-5440-4732-9afb-8f457127e836","name":{"en":"Mecha"}}]}

In the early post-war period the manga resumed serialization in the manga magazine Shojo, now under the title \"Kurumi-chan\", from November 1949 to February 1954. \n\nFeaturing the day-to-day of a little girl named Kurumi (クルミ, meaning \"chestnut\"), The chapters were episodic, each being around 4 pages. A gag work, with an emphasis on the everyday.\n\nKurumi-chan was later collected into two tankoban volumes in 1987, one year after Matsumoto's passing.\n\nAt the beginning of the Showa period (1926-1989), when the culture of Shojo magazines was flourishing and lyrical painters were competing with each other with their gorgeous brush strokes, Katsuji Matsumoto emerged as an artist of the new generation following Kayoi Takahata and Koji Fukiya, and his exotic and gorgeous style gained popularity with the likes of Junichi Nakahara.\n\nOn the other hand, he also drew bright and cute illustrations with a touch of humor, and challenged himself to create gag manga, freely manipulating contrasting styles and demonstrating a versatile artistic talent not found in existing artists.\n\nAmong his works, the manga \"Kurukuru Kurumi-chan\" was serialized in shojo manga magazines for 35 years from the early Showa period (1926-1989) and became a pioneer of shojo manga, as well as the originator of Japanese character goods, which were commercialized one after another as postcards, letter paper covers, and so on.\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say that the origin of \"Kawaii\" can be traced back to Kuru Kurumi-chan in the history of Japanese \" kawaii\" culture.\n\nCrowdfunding for an [Anime Pilot Adaptation](https://natalie.mu/comic/news/146764) was started in 2015."},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/%E6%9D%BE%E6%9C%AC%E3%81%8B%E3%81%A4%E3%81%A2/dp/4336022771/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8B%E3%81%8F%E3%82%8B%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AB%E3%83%9F%E3%81%A1%E3%82%83%E3%82%93\u0026qid=1678440230\u0026sr=8-1","mu":"1spbuwa","raw":"https://order.mandarake.co.jp/order/detailPage/item?itemCode=1104985478"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shoujo","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"3de8c75d-8ee3-48ff-98ee-e20a65c86451","name":{"en":"Animals"}},{"id":"423e2eae-a7a2-4a8b-ac03-a8351462d71d","name":{"en":"Romance"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"caaa44eb-cd40-4177-b930-79d3ef2afe87","name":{"en":"School Life"}},{"id":"e5301a23-ebd9-49dd-a0cb-2add944c7fe9","name":{"en":"Slice of Life"}}]}

In order to preserve their secrecy, the Crossbone forces attack the Anaheim test ship Bladewood. They expect an easy victory, but are repulsed by the Bladewood's mobile suits. In order to enact repairs from the damage they sustained at the hands of the Crossbone Vanguard, the Bladewood enters a nearby abandoned space colony in the Zebra Zone.   \n  \nInside the colony Iris, Tokio and Kevin are attacked by a Geara Doga. They successfully capture the machine and find the pilot to be a young girl by the name of Layla Lagiorr. After initially remaining silent she has an emotional outburst in which she explains that there are Zeon Remnants living in the colony and that six years ago the Federation came and slaughtered most of them.  \n  \nConfused by her story the Bladewood's crew decide to attempt to contact the Zeon Remnants and attempt to ascertain what is going on. They do so and discover the harsh reality of Federation forces that relishes killing the remnants of Zeon in a way similar to the Titans. Meanwhile the Ra Cailum class ESFS starship Ajax arrives at the colony in order to \"aid in repairs\" and transfer personnel under the command of Baz Galemson. Together the Zeon Remnants and the crew of the Bladewood realize that the situation surrounding them is not as it seems. Eventually, it is revealed that the crew of the Ajax knew of the existence of the Crossbone Vanguard and requested their help in \"killing 2 birds with 1 stone\", namely a group of Zeon refugees and the Bladewood crew. In desperation, Tokio steals the RX-99 Neo Gundam Unit 2 and joins forces with Layla to take down the corrupt Baz and the Ajax."},"links":{"amz":"https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00JXEFVZ8","ap":"mobile-suit-gundam-silhouette-formula-91","bw":"series/15715","ebj":"https://ebookjapan.yahoo.co.jp/books/236716/","kt":"31873","mal":"1873","mu":"12712"},"originalLanguage":"ja","publicationDemographic":"shounen","contentRating":"safe","tags":[{"id":"256c8bd9-4904-4360-bf4f-508a76d67183","name":{"en":"Sci-Fi"}},{"id":"391b0423-d847-456f-aff0-8b0cfc03066b","name":{"en":"Action"}},{"id":"3b60b75c-a2d7-4860-ab56-05f391bb889c","name":{"en":"Psychological"}},{"id":"4d32cc48-9f00-4cca-9b5a-a839f0764984","name":{"en":"Comedy"}},{"id":"50880a9d-5440-4732-9afb-8f457127e836","name":{"en":"Mecha"}},{"id":"5fff9cde-849c-4d78-aab0-0d52b2ee1d25","name":{"en":"Survival"}},{"id":"87cc87cd-a395-47af-b27a-93258283bbc6","name":{"en":"Adventure"}},{"id":"ac72833b-c4e9-4878-b9db-6c8a4a99444a","name":{"en":"Military"}},{"id":"b9af3a63-f058-46de-a9a0-e0c13906197a","name":{"en":"Drama"}}]}
